<h4>
	Earth</h4>
<p>
	Earth is one of the four classical elements in ancient Greek philosophy and science. It was commonly associated with qualities of heaviness, matter and the terrestrial world. Due to the hero cults, and chthonic underworld dieties, the elemental of earth is also associated with the sensual aspects of both life and death in later occultism.</p>

	Empedocles of Acragas (c. 495 &ndash; c. 435 BCE) proposed four archai by which to understand the cosmos: fire, air, water, and earth. This conception influential many philosophers and he is credited with establishing the four Empedoclian elements in Greek philosophy and science. Plato (427 &ndash; 347 BCE) believed the elements were geometric forms (the platonic solids) and he assigned the cube to the element of earth in his dialogue Timaeus. Aristotle, (384 &ndash; 322 BCE), believed earth was the heaviest element, and his theory of natural place suggested that any earth&ndash;laden substances, would fall quickly, straight down, toward the center of the cosmos.</p>

	In Classical Greek and Roman myth, various goddesses represented the Earth, crops and fertility, including Demeter and Persephone; Ceres and Proserpina); and Hades (Pluto) who ruled the souls of dead in the Underworld.</p>

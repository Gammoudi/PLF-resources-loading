     * Convenience method to set the <tt>accessible</tt> flag for an
     * array of objects with a single security check (for efficiency).
     *
     * <p>First, if there is a security manager, its
     * <code>checkPermission</code> method is called with a
     * <code>ReflectPermission("suppressAccessChecks")</code> permission.
     *
     * <p>A <code>SecurityException</code> is raised if <code>flag</code> is
     * <code>true</code> but accessibility of any of the elements of the input
     * <code>array</code> may not be changed (for example, if the element
     * object is a {@link Constructor} object for the class {@link
     * java.lang.Class}).  In the event of such a SecurityException, the
     * accessibility of objects is set to <code>flag</code> for array elements
     * upto (and excluding) the element for which the exception occurred; the
     * accessibility of elements beyond (and including) the element for which
     * the exception occurred is unchanged.
     *
     * @param array the array of AccessibleObjects
     * @param flag  the new value for the <tt>accessible</tt> flag
     *              in each object
     * @throws SecurityException if the request is denied.

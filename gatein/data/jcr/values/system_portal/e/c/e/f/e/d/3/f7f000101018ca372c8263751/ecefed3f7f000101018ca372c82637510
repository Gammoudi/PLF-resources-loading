 Represents an annotated element of the program currently running in this
 VM.  This interface allows annotations to be read reflectively.  All
 annotations returned by methods in this interface are immutable and
 serializable.  It is permissible for the caller to modify the
 arrays returned by accessors for array-valued enum members; it will
 have no affect on the arrays returned to other callers.

 <p>If an annotation returned by a method in this interface contains
 (directly or indirectly) a java.lang.Class-valued member referring to
 a class that is not accessible in this VM, attempting to read the class
 by calling the relevant Class-returning method on the returned annotation
 will result in a java.lang.TypeNotPresentException.

 <p>Similarly, attempting to read an enum-valued member will result in
 a java.lang.EnumConstantNotPresentException if the enum constant in the
 annotation is no longer present in the enum type.
 
 <p>Finally, Attempting to read a member whose definition has evolved
 incompatibly will result in a java.lang.annotation.AnnotationTypeMismatchException or an
 java.lang.annotation.IncompleteAnnotationException.

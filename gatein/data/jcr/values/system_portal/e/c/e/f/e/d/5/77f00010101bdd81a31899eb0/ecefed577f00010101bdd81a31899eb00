     * Returns all annotations that are directly present on this
     * element.  Unlike the other methods in this interface, this method
     * ignores inherited annotations.  (Returns an array of length zero if
     * no annotations are directly present on this element.)  The caller of
     * this method is free to modify the returned array; it will have no
     * effect on the arrays returned to other callers.

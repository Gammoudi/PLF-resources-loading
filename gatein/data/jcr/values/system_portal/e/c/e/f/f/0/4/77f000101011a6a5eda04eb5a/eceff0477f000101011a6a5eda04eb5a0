     * Returns an array of <tt>Type</tt> objects that represent the 
     * exceptions declared to be thrown by this <tt>Constructor</tt> object. 
     * Returns an array of length 0 if the underlying method declares
     * no exceptions in its <tt>throws</tt> clause.  
     * 
     * <p>If an exception type is a parameterized type, the <tt>Type</tt>
     * object returned for it must accurately reflect the actual type
     * parameters used in the source code.
     *
     * <p>If an exception type is a type variable or a parameterized 
     * type, it is created. Otherwise, it is resolved.

     * @return an array of Types that represent the exception types
     *     thrown by the underlying method
     * @throws GenericSignatureFormatError
     *     if the generic method signature does not conform to the format
     *     specified in the Java Virtual Machine Specification, 3rd edition
     * @throws TypeNotPresentException if the underlying method's
     *     <tt>throws</tt> clause refers to a non-existent type declaration
     * @throws MalformedParameterizedTypeException if
     *     the underlying method's <tt>throws</tt> clause refers to a
     *     parameterized type that cannot be instantiated for any reason

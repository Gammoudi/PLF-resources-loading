     * Returns the approximate accumulated collection elapsed time 
     * in milliseconds.  This method returns <tt>-1</tt> if the collection 
     * elapsed time is undefined for this collector.
     * <p>
     * The Java virtual machine implementation may use a high resolution
     * timer to measure the elapsed time.  This method may return the
     * same value even if the collection count has been incremented
     * if the collection elapsed time is very short.

     * @return the approximate accumulated collection elapsed time

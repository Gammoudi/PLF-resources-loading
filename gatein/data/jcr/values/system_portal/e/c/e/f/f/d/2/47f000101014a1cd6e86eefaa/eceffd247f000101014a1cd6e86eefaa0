 
     * Returns the current memory usage of the heap that
     * is used for object allocation.  The heap consists 
     * of one or more memory pools.  The <tt>used</tt>
     * and <tt>committed</tt> size of the returned memory
     * usage is the sum of those values of all heap memory pools
     * whereas the <tt>init</tt> and <tt>max</tt> size of the
     * returned memory usage represents the setting of the heap
     * memory which may not be the sum of those of all heap
     * memory pools.
     * <p>
     * The amount of used memory in the returned memory usage
     * is the amount of memory occupied by both live objects
     * and garbage objects that have not been collected, if any.

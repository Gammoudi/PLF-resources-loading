 
     * Returns the current memory usage of non-heap memory that
     * is used by the Java virtual machine.
     * The non-heap memory consists of one or more memory pools.  
     * The <tt>used</tt> and <tt>committed</tt> size of the 
     * returned memory usage is the sum of those values of 
     * all non-heap memory pools whereas the <tt>init</tt> 
     * and <tt>max</tt> size of the returned memory usage 
     * represents the setting of the non-heap
     * memory which may not be the sum of those of all non-heap
     * memory pools.

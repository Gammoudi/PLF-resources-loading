     * Returns an estimate of the memory usage of this memory pool.
     * This method returns <tt>null</tt>
     * if this memory pool is not valid (i.e. no longer exists).
     *
     * <p>
     * This method requests the Java virtual machine to make
     * a best-effort estimate of the current memory usage of this
     * memory pool. For some memory pools, this method may be an
     * expensive operation that requires some computation to determine
     * the estimate.  An implementation should document when
     * this is the case.
     *
     * <p>This method is designed for use in monitoring system
     * memory usage and detecting low memory condition.

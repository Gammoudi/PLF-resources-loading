     * Returns the system load average for the last minute.
     * The system load average is the sum of the number of runnable entities
     * queued to the {@linkplain #getAvailableProcessors available processors}
     * and the number of runnable entities running on the available processors
     * averaged over a period of time.
     * The way in which the load average is calculated is operating system
     * specific but is typically a damped time-dependent average.
     * <p>
     * If the load average is not available, a negative value is returned.
     * <p>
     * This method is designed to provide a hint about the system load
     * and may be queried frequently.
     * The load average may be unavailable on some platform where it is
     * expensive to implement this method.
     *
     * @return the system load average; or a negative value if not available.

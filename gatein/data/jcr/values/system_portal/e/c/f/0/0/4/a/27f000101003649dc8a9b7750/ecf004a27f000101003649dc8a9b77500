     * Returns the total CPU time for the current thread in nanoseconds.
     * The returned value is of nanoseconds precision but
     * not necessarily nanoseconds accuracy.
     * If the implementation distinguishes between user mode time and system 
     * mode time, the returned CPU time is the amount of time that 
     * the current thread has executed in user mode or system mode.
     *
     * <p>
     * This is a convenient method for local management use and is 
     * equivalent to calling:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     *   {@link #getThreadCpuTime getThreadCpuTime}(Thread.currentThread().getId());
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * @return the total CPU time for the current thread if CPU time
     * measurement is enabled; <tt>-1</tt> otherwise.
     *
     * @throws java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException if the Java 
     * virtual machine does not support CPU time measurement for
     * the current thread.

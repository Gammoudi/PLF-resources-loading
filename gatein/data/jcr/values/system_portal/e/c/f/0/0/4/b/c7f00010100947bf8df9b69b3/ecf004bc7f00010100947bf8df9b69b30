     * Returns a thread info for a thread of the specified <tt>id</tt>,
     * with stack trace of a specified number of stack trace elements.
     * The <tt>maxDepth</tt> parameter indicates the maximum number of 
     * {@link StackTraceElement} to be retrieved from the stack trace.
     * If <tt>maxDepth == Integer.MAX_VALUE</tt>, the entire stack trace of 
     * the thread will be dumped. 
     * If <tt>maxDepth == 0</tt>, no stack trace of the thread 
     * will be dumped. 
     * This method does not obtain the locked monitors and locked 
     * synchronizers of the thread.
     * <p>
     * When the Java virtual machine has no stack trace information 
     * about a thread or <tt>maxDepth == 0</tt>, 
     * the stack trace in the

     * If a thread of the given ID is not alive or does not exist, 
     * this method will return <tt>null</tt>.  A thread is alive if 
     * it has been started and has not yet died.

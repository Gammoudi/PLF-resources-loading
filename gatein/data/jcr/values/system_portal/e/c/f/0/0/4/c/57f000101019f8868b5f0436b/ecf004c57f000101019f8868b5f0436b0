     * Returns the CPU time that a thread of the specified ID 
     * has executed in user mode in nanoseconds.
     * The returned value is of nanoseconds precision but
     * not necessarily nanoseconds accuracy.
     *
     * <p>
     * If the thread of the specified ID is not alive or does not exist,
     * this method returns <tt>-1</tt>. If CPU time measurement
     * is disabled, this method returns <tt>-1</tt>.
     * A thread is alive if it has been started and has not yet died.
     * <p>
     * If CPU time measurement is enabled after the thread has started,
     * the Java virtual machine implementation may choose any time up to
     * and including the time that the capability is enabled as the point
     * where CPU time measurement starts.
     *
     * @param id the thread ID of a thread
     * @return the user-level CPU time for a thread of the specified ID
     * if the thread of the specified ID exists, the thread is alive,
     * and CPU time measurement is enabled;
     * <tt>-1</tt> otherwise.
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if <tt>id &lt= 0 </tt>.
     * @throws java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException if the Java 
     * virtual machine does not support CPU time measurement for 
     * other threads.

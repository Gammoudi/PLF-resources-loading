 A <tt>CharSequence</tt> is a readable sequence of <code>char</code> values. This
 interface provides uniform, read-only access to many different kinds of
 <code>char</code> sequences.
 A <code>char</code> value represents a character in the <i>Basic
 Multilingual Plane (BMP)</i> or a surrogate. Refer to <a
 href="Character.html#unicode">Unicode Character Representation</a> for details.

 <p> This interface does not refine the general contracts of the <a href='../java/lang/Object.html#equals(java.lang.Object)' title='equals'>equals</a> and <a href='../java/lang/Object.html#hashCode()' title='hashCode'>hashCode</a> methods.  The result of comparing two
 objects that implement <tt>CharSequence</tt> is therefore, in general,
 undefined.  Each object may be implemented by a different class, and there
 is no guarantee that each class will be capable of testing its instances
 for equality with those of the other.  It is therefore inappropriate to use
 arbitrary <tt>CharSequence</tt> instances as elements in a set or as keys in
 a map. </p><DL><DT><B>spec:</B></DT><DD>JSR-51</DD></DL>

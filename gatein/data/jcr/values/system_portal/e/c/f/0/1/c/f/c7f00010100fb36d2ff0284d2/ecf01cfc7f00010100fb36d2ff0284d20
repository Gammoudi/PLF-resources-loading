     * will return <tt>null</tt> in such implementations if this class loader's

     *
     * <p> If a security manager is present, and the invoker's class loader is
     * not <tt>null</tt> and is not an ancestor of this class loader, then this
     * method invokes the security manager's {@link

     * <tt>checkPermission</tt>} method with a {@link
     * RuntimePermission#RuntimePermission(String)
     * <tt>RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")</tt>} permission to verify
     * access to the parent class loader is permitted.  If not, a
     * <tt>SecurityException</tt> will be thrown.  </p>

     * Sets the desired assertion status for the named top-level class in this
     * class loader and any nested classes contained therein.  This setting
     * takes precedence over the class loader's default assertion status, and
     * over any applicable per-package default.  This method has no effect if
     * the named class has already been initialized.  (Once a class is
     * initialized, its assertion status cannot change.)
     *
     * <p> If the named class is not a top-level class, this invocation will
     * have no effect on the actual assertion status of any class. </p>
     *
     * @param  className
     *         The fully qualified class name of the top-level class whose
     *         assertion status is to be set.
     *
     * @param  enabled
     *         <tt>true</tt> if the named class is to have assertions
     *         enabled when (and if) it is initialized, <tt>false</tt> if the
     *         class is to have assertions disabled.

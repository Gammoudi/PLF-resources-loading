 The inner class NativeLibrary denotes a loaded native library instance.
 Every classloader contains a vector of loaded native libraries in the
 private field <tt>nativeLibraries</tt>.  The native libraries loaded
 into the system are entered into the <tt>systemNativeLibraries</tt>
 vector.

 <p> Every native library requires a particular version of JNI. This is
 denoted by the private <tt>jniVersion</tt> field.  This field is set by
 the VM when it loads the library, and used by the VM to pass the correct
 version of JNI to the native methods.  </p>

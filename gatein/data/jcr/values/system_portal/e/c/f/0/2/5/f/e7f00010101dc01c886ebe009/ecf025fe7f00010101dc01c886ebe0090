     * Returns the Class object corresponding to this enum constant's

     * same enum type if and only if
     *   e1.getDeclaringClass() == e2.getDeclaringClass().
     * (The value returned by this method may differ from the one returned
     * by the {@link Object#getClass} method for enum constants with
     * constant-specific class bodies.)

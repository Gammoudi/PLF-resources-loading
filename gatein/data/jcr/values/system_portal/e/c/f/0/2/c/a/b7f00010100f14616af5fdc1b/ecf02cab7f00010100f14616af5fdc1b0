     * Computes the remainder operation on two arguments as prescribed 
     * by the IEEE 754 standard.
     * The remainder value is mathematically equal to 
     * <code>f1&nbsp;-&nbsp;f2</code>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<i>n</i>,
     * where <i>n</i> is the mathematical integer closest to the exact 
     * mathematical value of the quotient <code>f1/f2</code>, and if two 
     * mathematical integers are equally close to <code>f1/f2</code>, 
     * then <i>n</i> is the integer that is even. If the remainder is 
     * zero, its sign is the same as the sign of the first argument. 
     * Special cases:
     * <ul><li>If either argument is NaN, or the first argument is infinite, 
     * or the second argument is positive zero or negative zero, then the 
     * result is NaN.
     * <li>If the first argument is finite and the second argument is 
     * infinite, then the result is the same as the first argument.</ul>
     *
     * @param   f1   the dividend.
     * @param   f2   the divisor.
     * @return  the remainder when <code>f1</code> is divided by
     *          <code>f2</code>.

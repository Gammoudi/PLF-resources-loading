     * Returns the arc cosine of a value; the returned angle is in the
     * range 0.0 through <i>pi</i>.  Special case:
     * <ul><li>If the argument is NaN or its absolute value is greater 
     * than 1, then the result is NaN.</ul>
     * 
     * <p>The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result.
     * Results must be semi-monotonic.
     *
     * @param   a   the value whose arc cosine is to be returned.
     * @return  the arc cosine of the argument.

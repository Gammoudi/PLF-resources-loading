     * Returns the arc tangent of a value; the returned angle is in the
     * range -<i>pi</i>/2 through <i>pi</i>/2.  Special cases:
     * <ul><li>If the argument is NaN, then the result is NaN.
     * <li>If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with the
     * same sign as the argument.</ul>
     * 
     * <p>The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result.
     * Results must be semi-monotonic.
     *
     * @param   a   the value whose arc tangent is to be returned.
     * @return  the arc tangent of the argument.

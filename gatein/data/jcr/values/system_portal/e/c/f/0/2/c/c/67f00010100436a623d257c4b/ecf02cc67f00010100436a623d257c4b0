     * Returns the cube root of a <code>double</code> value.  For
     * positive finite <code>x</code>, <code>cbrt(-x) ==
     * -cbrt(x)</code>; that is, the cube root of a negative value is
     * the negative of the cube root of that value's magnitude.
     * 
     * Special cases: 
     *
     * <ul>
     * 
     * <li>If the argument is NaN, then the result is NaN.
     *
     * <li>If the argument is infinite, then the result is an infinity
     * with the same sign as the argument.
     *
     * <li>If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with the
     * same sign as the argument.
     * 
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result.
     * 
     * @param   a   a value.
     * @return  the cube root of <code>a</code>.

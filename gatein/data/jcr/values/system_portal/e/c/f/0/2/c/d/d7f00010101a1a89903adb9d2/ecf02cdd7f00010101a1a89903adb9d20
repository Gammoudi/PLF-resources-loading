     * Returns the largest (closest to positive infinity)
     * <code>double</code> value that is less than or equal to the
     * argument and is equal to a mathematical integer. Special cases:
     * <ul><li>If the argument value is already equal to a
     * mathematical integer, then the result is the same as the
     * argument.  <li>If the argument is NaN or an infinity or
     * positive zero or negative zero, then the result is the same as
     * the argument.</ul>

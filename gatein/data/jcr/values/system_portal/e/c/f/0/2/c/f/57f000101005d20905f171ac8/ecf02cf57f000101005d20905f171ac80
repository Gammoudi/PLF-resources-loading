     * Returns the natural logarithm of the sum of the argument and 1.
     * Note that for small values <code>x</code>, the result of
     * <code>log1p(x)</code> is much closer to the true result of ln(1
     * + <code>x</code>) than the floating-point evaluation of
     * <code>log(1.0+x)</code>.
     *
     * <p>Special cases:
     *
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>If the argument is NaN or less than -1, then the result is
     * NaN.
     *
     * <li>If the argument is positive infinity, then the result is
     * positive infinity.
     *
     * <li>If the argument is negative one, then the result is
     * negative infinity.
     *
     * <li>If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with the
     * same sign as the argument.
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result.
     * Results must be semi-monotonic.

     * Returns the floating-point value adjacent to {@code d} in
     * the direction of positive infinity.  This method is
     * semantically equivalent to {@code nextAfter(d,
     * Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY)}; however, a {@code nextUp}
     * implementation may run faster than its equivalent
     * {@code nextAfter} call.
     *
     * <p>Special Cases:
     * <ul>
     * <li> If the argument is NaN, the result is NaN.
     *
     * <li> If the argument is positive infinity, the result is
     * positive infinity.
     *
     * <li> If the argument is zero, the result is
     * {@link Double#MIN_VALUE}
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param d starting floating-point value
     * @return The adjacent floating-point value closer to positive
     * infinity.

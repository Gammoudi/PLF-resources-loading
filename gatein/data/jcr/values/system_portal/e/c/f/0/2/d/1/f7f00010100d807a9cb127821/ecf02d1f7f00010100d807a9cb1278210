     * Returns a <code>double</code> value with a positive sign, greater 
     * than or equal to <code>0.0</code> and less than <code>1.0</code>. 
     * Returned values are chosen pseudorandomly with (approximately) 
     * uniform distribution from that range. 
     * 
     * <p>When this method is first called, it creates a single new
     * pseudorandom-number generator, exactly as if by the expression
     * <blockquote><pre>new java.util.Random</pre></blockquote> This
     * new pseudorandom-number generator is used thereafter for all
     * calls to this method and is used nowhere else.
     * 
     * <p>This method is properly synchronized to allow correct use by
     * more than one thread. However, if many threads need to generate
     * pseudorandom numbers at a great rate, it may reduce contention
     * for each thread to have its own pseudorandom-number generator.
     *  
     * @return  a pseudorandom <code>double</code> greater than or equal 
     * to <code>0.0</code> and less than <code>1.0</code>.
     * @see     java.util.Random#nextDouble()

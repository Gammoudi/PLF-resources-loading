     * Returns the <code>double</code> value that is closest in value
     * to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer. If two
     * <code>double</code> values that are mathematical integers are
     * equally close, the result is the integer value that is
     * even. Special cases:
     * <ul><li>If the argument value is already equal to a mathematical 
     * integer, then the result is the same as the argument. 
     * <li>If the argument is NaN or an infinity or positive zero or negative 
     * zero, then the result is the same as the argument.</ul>
     *
     * @param   a   a <code>double</code> value.
     * @return  the closest floating-point value to <code>a</code> that is
     *          equal to a mathematical integer.

     * Returns the trigonometric sine of an angle.  Special cases:
     * <ul><li>If the argument is NaN or an infinity, then the 
     * result is NaN.
     * <li>If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with the
     * same sign as the argument.</ul>
     * 
     * <p>The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result.
     * Results must be semi-monotonic.
     *
     * @param   a   an angle, in radians.
     * @return  the sine of the argument.

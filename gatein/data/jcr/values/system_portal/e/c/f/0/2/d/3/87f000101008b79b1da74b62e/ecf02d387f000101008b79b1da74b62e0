     * Returns the hyperbolic sine of a <code>double</code> value.
     * The hyperbolic sine of <i>x</i> is defined to be
     * (<i>e<sup>x</sup>&nbsp;-&nbsp;e<sup>-x</sup></i>)/2
     * where <i>e</i> is {@linkplain Math#E Euler's number}.
     *
     * <p>Special cases:
     * <ul>
     *
     * <li>If the argument is NaN, then the result is NaN.
     *
     * <li>If the argument is infinite, then the result is an infinity
     * with the same sign as the argument.
     *
     * <li>If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with the
     * same sign as the argument.
     *
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>The computed result must be within 2.5 ulps of the exact result.
     *
     * @param   x The number whose hyperbolic sine is to be returned.
     * @return  The hyperbolic sine of <code>x</code>.

     * Converts an angle measured in radians to an approximately
     * equivalent angle measured in degrees.  The conversion from
     * radians to degrees is generally inexact; users should
     * <i>not</i> expect <code>cos(toRadians(90.0))</code> to exactly
     * equal <code>0.0</code>.
     *
     * @param   angrad   an angle, in radians
     * @return  the measurement of the angle <code>angrad</code>
     *          in degrees.

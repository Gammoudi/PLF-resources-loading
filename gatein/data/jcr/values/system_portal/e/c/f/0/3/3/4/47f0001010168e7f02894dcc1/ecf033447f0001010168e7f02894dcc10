 Thrown if the Java Virtual Machine or a <code>ClassLoader</code> instance
 tries to load in the definition of a class (as part of a normal method call
 or as part of creating a new instance using the <code>new</code> expression)
 and no definition of the class could be found. 
 <p>
 The searched-for class definition existed when the currently 
 executing class was compiled, but the definition can no longer be 
 found.

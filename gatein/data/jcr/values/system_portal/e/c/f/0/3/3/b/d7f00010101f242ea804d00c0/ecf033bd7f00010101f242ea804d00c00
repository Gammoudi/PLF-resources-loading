 Thrown if an application tries to call a specified method of a 
 class (either static or instance), and that class no longer has a 
 definition of that method. 
 <p>
 Normally, this error is caught by the compiler; this error can 
 only occur at run time if the definition of a class has 
 incompatibly changed.

 The <code>Runnable</code> interface should be implemented by any
 class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread. The
 class must define a method of no arguments called <code>run</code>.
 <p>
 This interface is designed to provide a common protocol for objects that
 wish to execute code while they are active. For example,
 <code>Runnable</code> is implemented by class <code>Thread</code>.
 Being active simply means that a thread has been started and has not
 yet been stopped.
 <p>
 In addition, <code>Runnable</code> provides the means for a class to be
 active while not subclassing <code>Thread</code>. A class that implements
 <code>Runnable</code> can run without subclassing <code>Thread</code>
 by instantiating a <code>Thread</code> instance and passing itself in
 as the target.  In most cases, the <code>Runnable</code> interface should
 be used if you are only planning to override the <code>run()</code>
 method and no other <code>Thread</code> methods.
 This is important because classes should not be subclassed
 unless the programmer intends on modifying or enhancing the fundamental
 behavior of the class.

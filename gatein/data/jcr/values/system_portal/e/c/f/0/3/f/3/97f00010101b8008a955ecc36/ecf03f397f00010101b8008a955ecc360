     * examples may be regarded as typical:

     * <li>
     *   <tt>"MyClass.mash(MyClass.java:9)"</tt> - Here, <tt>"MyClass"</tt>
     *   is the <i>fully-qualified name</i> of the class containing the
     *   execution point represented by this stack trace element,
     *   <tt>"mash"</tt> is the name of the method containing the execution
     *   point, <tt>"MyClass.java"</tt> is the source file containing the
     *   execution point, and <tt>"9"</tt> is the line number of the source
     *   line containing the execution point.
     * <li>
     *   <tt>"MyClass.mash(MyClass.java)"</tt> - As above, but the line
     *   number is unavailable.
     * <li>
     *   <tt>"MyClass.mash(Unknown Source)"</tt> - As above, but neither
     *   the file name nor the line  number are available.
     * <li>
     *   <tt>"MyClass.mash(Native Method)"</tt> - As above, but neither
     *   the file name nor the line  number are available, and the method
     *   containing the execution point is known to be a native method.
     * </ul>

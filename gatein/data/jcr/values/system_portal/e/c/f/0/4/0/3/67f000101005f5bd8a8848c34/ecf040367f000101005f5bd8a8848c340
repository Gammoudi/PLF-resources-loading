     * Compares two strings lexicographically, ignoring case
     * differences. This method returns an integer whose sign is that of
     * calling <code>compareTo</code> with normalized versions of the strings
     * where case differences have been eliminated by calling
     * <code>Character.toLowerCase(Character.toUpperCase(character))</code> on
     * each character.
     * <p>
     * Note that this method does <em>not</em> take locale into account,
     * and will result in an unsatisfactory ordering for certain locales.
     * The java.text package provides <em>collators</em> to allow
     * locale-sensitive ordering.
     *
     * @param   str   the <code>String</code> to be compared.
     * @return  a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the
     *		specified String is greater than, equal to, or less
     *		than this String, ignoring case considerations.

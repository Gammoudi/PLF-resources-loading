     * are equal ignoring case.
     *
     * <p> Two characters {@code c1} and {@code c2} are considered the same
     * ignoring case if at least one of the following is true:
     * <ul>
     *   <li> The two characters are the same (as compared by the
     *        {@code ==} operator)
     *   <li> Applying the method {@link
     *        java.lang.Character#toUpperCase(char)} to each character
     *        produces the same result
     *   <li> Applying the method {@link
     *        java.lang.Character#toLowerCase(char)} to each character
     *        produces the same result
     * </ul>

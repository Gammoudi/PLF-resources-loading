     * Returns the index within this string of the first occurrence of
     * the specified character. If a character with value
     * <code>ch</code> occurs in the character sequence represented by
     * this <code>String</code> object, then the index (in Unicode
     * code units) of the first such occurrence is returned. For
     * values of <code>ch</code> in the range from 0 to 0xFFFF
     * (inclusive), this is the smallest value <i>k</i> such that:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * this.charAt(<i>k</i>) == ch
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * is true. For other values of <code>ch</code>, it is the
     * smallest value <i>k</i> such that:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * this.codePointAt(<i>k</i>) == ch
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * is true. In either case, if no such character occurs in this
     * string, then <code>-1</code> is returned.
     *
     * @param   ch   a character (Unicode code point).
     * @return  the index of the first occurrence of the character in the
     *          character sequence represented by this object, or
     *          <code>-1</code> if the character does not occur.

     * Returns a canonical representation for the string object.
     * <p>
     * A pool of strings, initially empty, is maintained privately by the
     * class <code>String</code>.
     * <p>
     * When the intern method is invoked, if the pool already contains a
     * string equal to this <code>String</code> object as determined by
     * the {@link #equals(Object)} method, then the string from the pool is
     * returned. Otherwise, this <code>String</code> object is added to the
     * pool and a reference to this <code>String</code> object is returned.
     * <p>
     * It follows that for any two strings <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>,
     * <code>s.intern()&nbsp;==&nbsp;t.intern()</code> is <code>true</code>
     * if and only if <code>s.equals(t)</code> is <code>true</code>.
     * <p>
     * All literal strings and string-valued constant expressions are
     * interned. String literals are defined in &sect;3.10.5 of the
     * <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/html/">Java Language
     * Specification</a>
     *
     * @return  a string that has the same contents as this string, but is
     *          guaranteed to be from a pool of unique strings.

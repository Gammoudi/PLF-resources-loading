     * Returns the index within this string of the last occurrence of
     * the specified character, searching backward starting at the
     * specified index. For values of <code>ch</code> in the range
     * from 0 to 0xFFFF (inclusive), the index returned is the largest
     * value <i>k</i> such that:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * (this.charAt(<i>k</i>) == ch) && (<i>k</i> &lt;= fromIndex)
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * is true. For other values of <code>ch</code>, it is the
     * largest value <i>k</i> such that:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * (this.codePointAt(<i>k</i>) == ch) && (<i>k</i> &lt;= fromIndex)
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * is true. In either case, if no such character occurs in this
     * string at or before position <code>fromIndex</code>, then
     * <code>-1</code> is returned.
     *
     * <p>All indices are specified in <code>char</code> values
     * (Unicode code units).
     *
     * @param   ch          a character (Unicode code point).
     * @param   fromIndex   the index to start the search from. There is no
     *          restriction on the value of <code>fromIndex</code>. If it is
     *          greater than or equal to the length of this string, it has
     *          the same effect as if it were equal to one less than the
     *          length of this string: this entire string may be searched.
     *          If it is negative, it has the same effect as if it were -1:
     *          -1 is returned.
     * @return  the index of the last occurrence of the character in the
     *          character sequence represented by this object that is less
     *          than or equal to <code>fromIndex</code>, or <code>-1</code>
     *          if the character does not occur before that point.

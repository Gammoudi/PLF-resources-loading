     * Returns the index within this string of the rightmost occurrence
     * of the specified substring.  The rightmost empty string "" is
     * considered to occur at the index value <code>this.length()</code>.
     * The returned index is the largest value <i>k</i> such that
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * this.startsWith(str, k)
     * </pre></blockquote>
     * is true.
     *
     * @param   str   the substring to search for.
     * @return  if the string argument occurs one or more times as a substring
     *          within this object, then the index of the first character of
     *          the last such substring is returned. If it does not occur as
     *          a substring, <code>-1</code> is returned.

     * Returns a new string resulting from replacing all occurrences of
     * <code>oldChar</code> in this string with <code>newChar</code>.
     * <p>
     * If the character <code>oldChar</code> does not occur in the
     * character sequence represented by this <code>String</code> object,
     * then a reference to this <code>String</code> object is returned.
     * Otherwise, a new <code>String</code> object is created that
     * represents a character sequence identical to the character sequence
     * represented by this <code>String</code> object, except that every
     * occurrence of <code>oldChar</code> is replaced by an occurrence
     * of <code>newChar</code>.
     * <p>
     * Examples:
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * "mesquite in your cellar".replace('e', 'o')
     *         returns "mosquito in your collar"
     * "the war of baronets".replace('r', 'y')
     *         returns "the way of bayonets"
     * "sparring with a purple porpoise".replace('p', 't')
     *         returns "starring with a turtle tortoise"
     * "JonL".replace('q', 'x') returns "JonL" (no change)
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * @param   oldChar   the old character.
     * @param   newChar   the new character.
     * @return  a string derived from this string by replacing every

     * Returns a copy of the string, with leading and trailing whitespace
     * omitted.
     * <p>
     * If this <code>String</code> object represents an empty character
     * sequence, or the first and last characters of character sequence
     * represented by this <code>String</code> object both have codes
     * greater than <code>'&#92;u0020'</code> (the space character), then a
     * reference to this <code>String</code> object is returned.
     * <p>
     * Otherwise, if there is no character with a code greater than
     * <code>'&#92;u0020'</code> in the string, then a new
     * <code>String</code> object representing an empty string is created
     * and returned.
     * <p>
     * Otherwise, let <i>k</i> be the index of the first character in the
     * string whose code is greater than <code>'&#92;u0020'</code>, and let
     * <i>m</i> be the index of the last character in the string whose code
     * is greater than <code>'&#92;u0020'</code>. A new <code>String</code>
     * object is created, representing the substring of this string that
     * begins with the character at index <i>k</i> and ends with the
     * character at index <i>m</i>-that is, the result of
     * <code>this.substring(<i>k</i>,&nbsp;<i>m</i>+1)</code>.
     * <p>
     * This method may be used to trim whitespace (as defined above) from
     * the beginning and end of a string.
     *
     * @return  A copy of this string with leading and trailing white
     *          space removed, or this string if it has no leading or
     *          trailing white space.

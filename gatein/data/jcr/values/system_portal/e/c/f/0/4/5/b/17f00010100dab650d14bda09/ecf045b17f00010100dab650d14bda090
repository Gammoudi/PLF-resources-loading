 A mutable sequence of characters.  This class provides an API compatible
 with <code>StringBuffer</code>, but with no guarantee of synchronization.
 This class is designed for use as a drop-in replacement for
 <code>StringBuffer</code> in places where the string buffer was being
 used by a single thread (as is generally the case).   Where possible,
 it is recommended that this class be used in preference to
 <code>StringBuffer</code> as it will be faster under most implementations.
 
 <p>The principal operations on a <code>StringBuilder</code> are the 
 <code>append</code> and <code>insert</code> methods, which are 
 overloaded so as to accept data of any type. Each effectively 
 converts a given datum to a string and then appends or inserts the 
 characters of that string to the string builder. The 
 <code>append</code> method always adds these characters at the end 
 of the builder; the <code>insert</code> method adds the characters at 
 a specified point. 
 <p>
 For example, if <code>z</code> refers to a string builder object 
 whose current contents are "<code>start</code>", then 
 the method call <code>z.append("le")</code> would cause the string 
 builder to contain "<code>startle</code>", whereas 
 <code>z.insert(4, "le")</code> would alter the string builder to 
 contain "<code>starlet</code>". 
 <p>
 In general, if sb refers to an instance of a <code>StringBuilder</code>, 
 then <code>sb.append(x)</code> has the same effect as 
 <code>sb.insert(sb.length(),&nbsp;x)</code>.

 Every string builder has a capacity. As long as the length of the 
 character sequence contained in the string builder does not exceed 
 the capacity, it is not necessary to allocate a new internal 
 buffer. If the internal buffer overflows, it is automatically made larger.

 <p>Instances of <code>StringBuilder</code> are not safe for
 use by multiple threads. If such synchronization is required then it is
 recommended that <a href='../java/lang/StringBuffer.html' title='StringBuffer'>StringBuffer</a> be used.

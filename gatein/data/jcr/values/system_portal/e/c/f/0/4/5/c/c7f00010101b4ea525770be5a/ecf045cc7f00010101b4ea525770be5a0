     * Appends the specified <tt>StringBuffer</tt> to this sequence.
     * <p>
     * The characters of the <tt>StringBuffer</tt> argument are appended, 
     * in order, to this sequence, increasing the 
     * length of this sequence by the length of the argument. 
     * If <tt>sb</tt> is <tt>null</tt>, then the four characters 
     * <tt>"null"</tt> are appended to this sequence.
     * <p>
     * Let <i>n</i> be the length of this character sequence just prior to 
     * execution of the <tt>append</tt> method. Then the character at index 
     * <i>k</i> in the new character sequence is equal to the character at 
     * index <i>k</i> in the old character sequence, if <i>k</i> is less than 
     * <i>n</i>; otherwise, it is equal to the character at index <i>k-n</i> 
     * in the argument <code>sb</code>.
     *
     * @param   sb   the <tt>StringBuffer</tt> to append.
     * @return  a reference to this object.

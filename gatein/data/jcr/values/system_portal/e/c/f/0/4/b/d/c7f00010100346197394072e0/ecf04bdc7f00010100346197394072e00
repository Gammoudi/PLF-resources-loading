     * @deprecated This method was originally designed to destroy this
     *     thread without any cleanup. Any monitors it held would have
     *     remained locked. However, the method was never implemented.
     *     If if were to be implemented, it would be deadlock-prone in
     *     much the manner of {@link #suspend}. If the target thread held
     *     a lock protecting a critical system resource when it was
     *     destroyed, no thread could ever access this resource again.
     *     If another thread ever attempted to lock this resource, deadlock
     *     would result. Such deadlocks typically manifest themselves as
     *     "frozen" processes. For more information, see
     *     <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/concurrency/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html">
     *     Why are Thread.stop, Thread.suspend and Thread.resume Deprecated?</a>.

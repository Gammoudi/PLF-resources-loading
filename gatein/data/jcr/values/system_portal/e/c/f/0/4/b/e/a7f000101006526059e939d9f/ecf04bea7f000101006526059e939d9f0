     * the current thread's thread group and its subgroups. This method simply 
     * calls the <code>enumerate</code> method of the current thread's thread 
     * group with the array argument. 
     * <p>
     * First, if there is a security manager, that <code>enumerate</code>
     * method calls the security
     * manager's <code>checkAccess</code> method 
     * with the thread group as its argument. This may result 
     * in throwing a <code>SecurityException</code>. 
     *
     * @param tarray an array of Thread objects to copy to
     * @return  the number of threads put into the array
     * @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and its  
     *             <code>checkAccess</code> method doesn't allow the operation.

     * ClassLoader is provided by the creator of the thread for use
     * by code running in this thread when loading classes and resources.
     * If not set, the default is the ClassLoader context of the parent
     * Thread. The context ClassLoader of the primordial thread is
     * typically set to the class loader used to load the application.
     *
     * <p>First, if there is a security manager, and the caller's class
     * loader is not null and the caller's class loader is not the same as or
     * an ancestor of the context class loader for the thread whose
     * context class loader is being requested, then the security manager's
     * <code>checkPermission</code> 
     * method is called with a 
     * <code>RuntimePermission("getClassLoader")</code> permission
     *  to see if it's ok to get the context ClassLoader.. 
     *
     * @return the context ClassLoader for this Thread
     *
     * @throws SecurityException
     *        if a security manager exists and its 
     *        <code>checkPermission</code> method doesn't allow 
     *        getting the context ClassLoader.

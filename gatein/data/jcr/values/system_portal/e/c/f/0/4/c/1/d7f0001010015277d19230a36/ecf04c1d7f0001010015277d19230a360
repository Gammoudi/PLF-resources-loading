     * monitor lock on the specified object.
     *
     * <p>This method is designed to allow a program to assert that
     * the current thread already holds a specified lock:
     * <pre>
     *     assert Thread.holdsLock(obj);
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param  obj the object on which to test lock ownership
     * @throws NullPointerException if obj is <tt>null</tt>
     * @return <tt>true</tt> if the current thread holds the monitor lock on
     *         the specified object.

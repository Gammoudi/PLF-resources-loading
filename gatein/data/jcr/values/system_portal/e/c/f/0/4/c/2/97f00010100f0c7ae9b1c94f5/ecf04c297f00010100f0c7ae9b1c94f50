     * Tests whether the current thread has been interrupted.  The
     * <i>interrupted status</i> of the thread is cleared by this method.  In
     * other words, if this method were to be called twice in succession, the
     * second call would return false (unless the current thread were
     * interrupted again, after the first call had cleared its interrupted
     * status and before the second call had examined it).
     *
     * <p>A thread interruption ignored because a thread was not alive 
     * at the time of the interrupt will be reflected by this method 
     * returning false.
     *
     * @return  <code>true</code> if the current thread has been interrupted;
     *          <code>false</code> otherwise.

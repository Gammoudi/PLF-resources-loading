     * First, the <code>checkAccess</code> method of this thread is called 
     * with no arguments. This may result in throwing a 
     * <code>SecurityException</code> (in the current thread). 
     * <p>
     * If the thread is alive but suspended, it is resumed and is 
     * permitted to make progress in its execution.

     * @exception  SecurityException  if the current thread cannot modify this

     * @deprecated This method exists solely for use with {@link #suspend},
     *     which has been deprecated because it is deadlock-prone.

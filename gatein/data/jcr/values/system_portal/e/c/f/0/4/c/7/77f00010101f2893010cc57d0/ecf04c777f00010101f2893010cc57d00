     * <p>A thread can take full control of how it responds to uncaught
     * exceptions by having its uncaught exception handler explicitly set.
     * If no such handler is set then the thread's <tt>ThreadGroup</tt>
     * object acts as its handler.
     * @param eh the object to use as this thread's uncaught exception
     * handler. If <tt>null</tt> then this thread has no explicit handler.
     * @throws  SecurityException  if the current thread is not allowed to
     *          modify this thread.

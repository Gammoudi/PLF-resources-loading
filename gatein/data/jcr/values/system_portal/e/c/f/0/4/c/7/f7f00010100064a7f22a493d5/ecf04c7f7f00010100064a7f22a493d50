     * Causes this thread to begin execution; the Java Virtual Machine 
     * calls the <code>run</code> method of this thread. 
     * <p>
     * The result is that two threads are running concurrently: the 
     * current thread (which returns from the call to the 
     * <code>start</code> method) and the other thread (which executes its 
     * <code>run</code> method). 
     * <p>
     * It is never legal to start a thread more than once.
     * In particular, a thread may not be restarted once it has completed
     * execution.

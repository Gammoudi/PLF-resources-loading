 A thread group represents a set of threads. In addition, a thread 
 group can also include other thread groups. The thread groups form 
 a tree in which every thread group except the initial thread group 
 has a parent. 
 <p>
 A thread is allowed to access information about its own thread 
 group, but not to access information about its thread group's 
 parent thread group or any other thread groups.

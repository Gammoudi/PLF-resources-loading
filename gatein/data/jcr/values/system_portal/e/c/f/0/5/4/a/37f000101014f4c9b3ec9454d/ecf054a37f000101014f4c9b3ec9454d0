     * Method childValue is visibly defined in subclass
     * InheritableThreadLocal, but is internally defined here for the
     * sake of providing createInheritedMap factory method without
     * needing to subclass the map class in InheritableThreadLocal.
     * This technique is preferable to the alternative of embedding
     * instanceof tests in methods.

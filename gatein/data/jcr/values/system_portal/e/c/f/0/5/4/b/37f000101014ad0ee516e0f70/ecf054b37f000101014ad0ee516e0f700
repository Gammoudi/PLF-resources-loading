     * Returns the current thread's "initial value" for this
     * thread-local variable.  This method will be invoked the first
     * time a thread accesses the variable with the {@link #get}
     * method, unless the thread previously invoked the {@link #set}
     * method, in which case the <tt>initialValue</tt> method will not
     * be invoked for the thread.  Normally, this method is invoked at
     * most once per thread, but it may be invoked again in case of
     * subsequent invocations of {@link #remove} followed by {@link #get}.

     * <p>This implementation simply returns <tt>null</tt>; if the
     * programmer desires thread-local variables to have an initial
     * value other than <tt>null</tt>, <tt>ThreadLocal</tt> must be
     * subclassed, and this method overridden.  Typically, an
     * anonymous inner class will be used.

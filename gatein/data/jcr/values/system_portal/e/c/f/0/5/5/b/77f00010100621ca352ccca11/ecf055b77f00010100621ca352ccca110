 ThreadLocalMap is a customized hash map suitable only for
 maintaining thread local values. No operations are exported
 outside of the ThreadLocal class. The class is package private to
 allow declaration of fields in class Thread.  To help deal with
 very large and long-lived usages, the hash table entries use
 WeakReferences for keys. However, since reference queues are not
 used, stale entries are guaranteed to be removed only when
 the table starts running out of space.

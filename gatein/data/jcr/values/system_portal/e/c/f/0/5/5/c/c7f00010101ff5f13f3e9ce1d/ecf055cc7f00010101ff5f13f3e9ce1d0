         * Expunge a stale entry by rehashing any possibly colliding entries
         * lying between staleSlot and the next null slot.  This also expunges
         * any other stale entries encountered before the trailing null.  See
         * Knuth, Section 6.4
         *
         * @param staleSlot index of slot known to have null key
         * @return the index of the next null slot after staleSlot
         * (all between staleSlot and this slot will have been checked
         * for expunging).

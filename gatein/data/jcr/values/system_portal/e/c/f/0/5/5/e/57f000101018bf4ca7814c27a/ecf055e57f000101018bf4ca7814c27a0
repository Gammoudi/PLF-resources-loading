         * Replace a stale entry encountered during a set operation
         * with an entry for the specified key.  The value passed in
         * the value parameter is stored in the entry, whether or not
         * an entry already exists for the specified key.
         *
         * As a side effect, this method expunges all stale entries in the
         * "run" containing the stale entry.  (A run is a sequence of entries
         * between two null slots.)
         *
         * @param  key the key
         * @param  value the value to be associated with key
         * @param  staleSlot index of the first stale entry encountered while
         *         searching for key.

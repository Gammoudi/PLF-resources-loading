 The entries in this hash map extend WeakReference, using
 its main ref field as the key (which is always a
 ThreadLocal object).  Note that null keys (i.e. entry.get()
 == null) mean that the key is no longer referenced, so the
 entry can be expunged from table.  Such entries are referred to
 as "stale entries" in the code that follows.

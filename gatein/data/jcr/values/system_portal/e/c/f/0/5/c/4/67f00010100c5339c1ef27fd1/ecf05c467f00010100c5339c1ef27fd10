     * Returns whether the current JVM configuration supports
     * {@linkplain #setNativeMethodPrefix(ClassFileTransformer,String)
     * setting a native method prefix}.
     * The ability to set a native method prefix is an optional
     * capability of a JVM.
     * Setting a native method prefix will only be supported if the 
     * <code>Can-Set-Native-Method-Prefix</code> manifest attribute is set to
     * <code>true</code> in the agent JAR file (as described in the 
     * {@linkplain java.lang.instrument package specification}) and the JVM supports
     * this capability.
     * During a single instantiation of a single JVM, multiple
     * calls to this method will always return the same answer.
     * @return  true if the current JVM configuration supports
     * setting a native method prefix, false if not.

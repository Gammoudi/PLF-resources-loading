     * Returns whether or not the current JVM configuration supports redefinition
     * of classes.
     * The ability to redefine an already loaded class is an optional capability
     * of a JVM.
     * Redefinition will only be supported if the 
     * <code>Can-Redefine-Classes</code> manifest attribute is set to
     * <code>true</code> in the agent JAR file (as described in the 
     * {@linkplain java.lang.instrument package specification}) and the JVM supports
     * this capability.
     * During a single instantiation of a single JVM, multiple calls to this
     * method will always return the same answer.
     * @return  true if the current JVM configuration supports redefinition of classes,
     * false if not.
     * @see #redefineClasses

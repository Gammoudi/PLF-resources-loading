 A reflection-based utility that enables atomic updates to
 designated <TT>volatile int</TT> fields of designated classes.
 This class is designed for use in atomic data structures in which
 several fields of the same node are independently subject to atomic
 updates.

 <p>Note that the guarantees of the <TT>compareAndSet</TT>
 method in this class are weaker than in other atomic classes.
 Because this class cannot ensure that all uses of the field
 are appropriate for purposes of atomic access, it can
 guarantee atomicity only with respect to other invocations of
 <TT>compareAndSet</TT> and <TT>set</TT> on the same updater.

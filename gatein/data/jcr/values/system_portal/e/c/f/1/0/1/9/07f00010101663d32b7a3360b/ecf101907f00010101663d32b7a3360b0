 A <TT>long</TT> value that may be updated atomically.  See the
 java.util.concurrent.atomic package specification for
 description of the properties of atomic variables. An
 <TT>AtomicLong</TT> is used in applications such as atomically
 incremented sequence numbers, and cannot be used as a replacement
 for a java.lang.Long. However, this class does extend
 <TT>Number</TT> to allow uniform access by tools and utilities that
 deal with numerically-based classes.

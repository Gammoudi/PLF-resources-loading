     * Atomically sets the value of the mark to the given update value
     * if the current reference is {@code ==} to the expected
     * reference.  Any given invocation of this operation may fail
     * (return {@code false}) spuriously, but repeated invocation
     * when the current value holds the expected value and no other
     * thread is also attempting to set the value will eventually
     * succeed.
     *
     * @param expectedReference the expected value of the reference
     * @param newMark the new value for the mark
     * @return true if successful

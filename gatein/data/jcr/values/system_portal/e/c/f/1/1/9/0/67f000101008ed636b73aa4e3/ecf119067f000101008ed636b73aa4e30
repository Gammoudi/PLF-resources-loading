 A task that returns a result and may throw an exception.
 Implementors define a single method with no arguments called
 <tt>call</tt>.

 <p>The <tt>Callable</tt> interface is similar to java.lang.Runnable, in that both are designed for classes whose
 instances are potentially executed by another thread.  A
 <tt>Runnable</tt>, however, does not return a result and cannot
 throw a checked exception.

 <p> The <a href='../java/util/concurrent/Executors.html' title='Executors'>Executors</a> class contains utility methods to
 convert from other common forms to <tt>Callable</tt> classes.

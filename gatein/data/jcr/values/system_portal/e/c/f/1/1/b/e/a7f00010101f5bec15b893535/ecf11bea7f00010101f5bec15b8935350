 A hash table supporting full concurrency of retrievals and
 adjustable expected concurrency for updates. This class obeys the
 same functional specification as java.util.Hashtable, and
 includes versions of methods corresponding to each method of
 <tt>Hashtable</tt>. However, even though all operations are
 thread-safe, retrieval operations do <em>not</em> entail locking,
 and there is <em>not</em> any support for locking the entire table
 in a way that prevents all access.  This class is fully
 interoperable with <tt>Hashtable</tt> in programs that rely on its
 thread safety but not on its synchronization details.

 <p> Retrieval operations (including <tt>get</tt>) generally do not
 block, so may overlap with update operations (including
 <tt>put</tt> and <tt>remove</tt>). Retrievals reflect the results
 of the most recently <em>completed</em> update operations holding
 upon their onset.  For aggregate operations such as <tt>putAll</tt>
 and <tt>clear</tt>, concurrent retrievals may reflect insertion or
 removal of only some entries.  Similarly, Iterators and
 Enumerations return elements reflecting the state of the hash table
 at some point at or since the creation of the iterator/enumeration.
 They do <em>not</em> throw java.util.ConcurrentModificationException.
 However, iterators are designed to be used by only one thread at a time.

 <p> The allowed concurrency among update operations is guided by
 the optional <tt>concurrencyLevel</tt> constructor argument
 (default <tt>16</tt>), which is used as a hint for internal sizing.  The
 table is internally partitioned to try to permit the indicated
 number of concurrent updates without contention. Because placement
 in hash tables is essentially random, the actual concurrency will
 vary.  Ideally, you should choose a value to accommodate as many
 threads as will ever concurrently modify the table. Using a
 significantly higher value than you need can waste space and time,
 and a significantly lower value can lead to thread contention. But
 overestimates and underestimates within an order of magnitude do
 not usually have much noticeable impact. A value of one is
 appropriate when it is known that only one thread will modify and
 all others will only read. Also, resizing this or any other kind of
 hash table is a relatively slow operation, so, when possible, it is
 a good idea to provide estimates of expected table sizes in
 constructors.

 <p>This class and its views and iterators implement all of the
 <em>optional</em> methods of the java.util.Map and java.util.Iterator
 interfaces.

 <p> Like java.util.Hashtable but unlike java.util.HashMap, this class
 does <em>not</em> allow <tt>null</tt> to be used as a key or value.

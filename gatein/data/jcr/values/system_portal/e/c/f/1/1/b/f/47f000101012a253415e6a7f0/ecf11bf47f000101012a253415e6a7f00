     * Creates a new, empty map with the specified initial capacity
     * and load factor and with the default concurrencyLevel (16).
     *
     * @param initialCapacity The implementation performs internal
     * sizing to accommodate this many elements.
     * @param loadFactor  the load factor threshold, used to control resizing.
     * Resizing may be performed when the average number of elements per
     * bin exceeds this threshold.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the initial capacity of
     * elements is negative or the load factor is nonpositive

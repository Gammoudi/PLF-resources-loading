     * Legacy method testing if some key maps into the specified value
     * in this table.  This method is identical in functionality to
     * {@link #containsValue}, and exists solely to ensure
     * full compatibility with class {@link java.util.Hashtable},
     * which supported this method prior to introduction of the
     * Java Collections framework.

     * @param  value a value to search for
     * @return <tt>true</tt> if and only if some key maps to the
     *         <tt>value</tt> argument in this table as
     *         determined by the <tt>equals</tt> method;
     *         <tt>false</tt> otherwise
     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified value is null

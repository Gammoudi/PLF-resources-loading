     * Applies a supplemental hash function to a given hashCode, which
     * defends against poor quality hash functions.  This is critical
     * because ConcurrentHashMap uses power-of-two length hash tables,
     * that otherwise encounter collisions for hashCodes that do not
     * differ in lower or upper bits.

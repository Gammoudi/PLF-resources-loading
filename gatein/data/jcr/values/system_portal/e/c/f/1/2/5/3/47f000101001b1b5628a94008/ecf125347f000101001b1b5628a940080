         * value to return is somewhat arbitrary here. Since a
         * WriteThroughEntry does not necessarily track asynchronous
         * changes, the most recent "previous" value could be
         * different from what we return (or could even have been
         * removed in which case the put will re-establish). We do not
         * and cannot guarantee more.

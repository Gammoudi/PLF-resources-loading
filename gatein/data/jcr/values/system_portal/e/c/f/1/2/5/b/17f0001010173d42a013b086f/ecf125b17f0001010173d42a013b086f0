     * Returns the first live (non-deleted) node on list, or null if none.
     * This is yet another variant of poll/peek; here returning the
     * first node, not element. We could make peek() a wrapper around
     * first(), but that would cost an extra volatile read of item,
     * and the need to add a retry loop to deal with the possibility
     * of losing a race to a concurrent poll().

     * Returns an iterator over the elements in this queue in proper sequence.
     * The returned iterator is a "weakly consistent" iterator that
     * will never throw {@link  java.util.ConcurrentModificationException
     * ConcurrentModificationException},
     * and guarantees to traverse elements as they existed upon
     * construction of the iterator, and may (but is not guaranteed to)
     * reflect any modifications subsequent to construction.

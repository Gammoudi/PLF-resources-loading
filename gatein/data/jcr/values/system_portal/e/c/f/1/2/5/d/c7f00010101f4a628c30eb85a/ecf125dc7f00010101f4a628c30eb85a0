     * Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue, in
     * proper sequence; the runtime type of the returned array is that of
     * the specified array.  If the queue fits in the specified array, it
     * is returned therein.  Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the
     * runtime type of the specified array and the size of this queue.
     *
     * <p>If this queue fits in the specified array with room to spare
     * (i.e., the array has more elements than this queue), the element in
     * the array immediately following the end of the queue is set to
     * {@code null}.
     *
     * <p>Like the {@link #toArray()} method, this method acts as bridge between
     * array-based and collection-based APIs.  Further, this method allows
     * precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
     * under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.
     *
     * <p>Suppose {@code x} is a queue known to contain only strings.
     * The following code can be used to dump the queue into a newly
     * allocated array of {@code String}:
     *
     * <pre>
     *     String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);</pre>
     *
     * Note that {@code toArray(new Object[0])} is identical in function to
     * {@code toArray()}.
     *
     * @param a the array into which the elements of the queue are to
     *          be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
     *          same runtime type is allocated for this purpose
     * @return an array containing all of the elements in this queue
     * @throws ArrayStoreException if the runtime type of the specified array
     *         is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in
     *         this queue
     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified array is null

     * Specialized variant of findNode to perform Map.get. Does a weak
     * traversal, not bothering to fix any deleted index nodes,
     * returning early if it happens to see key in index, and passing
     * over any deleted base nodes, falling back to getUsingFindNode
     * only if it would otherwise return value from an ongoing
     * deletion. Also uses "bound" to eliminate need for some
     * comparisons (see Pugh Cookbook). Also folds uses of null checks
     * and node-skipping because markers have null keys.
     * @param okey the key
     * @return the value, or null if absent

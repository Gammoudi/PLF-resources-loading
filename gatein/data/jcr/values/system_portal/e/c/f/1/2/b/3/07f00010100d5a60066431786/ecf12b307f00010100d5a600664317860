     * Main deletion method. Locates node, nulls value, appends a
     * deletion marker, unlinks predecessor, removes associated index
     * nodes, and possibly reduces head index level.
     *
     * Index nodes are cleared out simply by calling findPredecessor.
     * which unlinks indexes to deleted nodes found along path to key,
     * which will include the indexes to this node.  This is done
     * unconditionally. We can't check beforehand whether there are
     * index nodes because it might be the case that some or all
     * indexes hadn't been inserted yet for this node during initial
     * search for it, and we'd like to ensure lack of garbage
     * retention, so must call to be sure.
     *
     * @param okey the key
     * @param value if non-null, the value that must be
     * associated with key
     * @return the node, or null if not found

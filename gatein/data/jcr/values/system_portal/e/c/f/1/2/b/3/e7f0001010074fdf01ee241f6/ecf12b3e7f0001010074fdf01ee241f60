     * Compares the specified object with this map for equality.
     * Returns <tt>true</tt> if the given object is also a map and the
     * two maps represent the same mappings.  More formally, two maps
     * <tt>m1</tt> and <tt>m2</tt> represent the same mappings if
     * <tt>m1.entrySet().equals(m2.entrySet())</tt>.  This
     * operation may return misleading results if either map is
     * concurrently modified during execution of this method.
     *
     * @param o object to be compared for equality with this map
     * @return <tt>true</tt> if the specified object is equal to this map

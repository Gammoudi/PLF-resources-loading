     * Returns a base-level node with key strictly less than given key,
     * or the base-level header if there is no such node.  Also
     * unlinks indexes to deleted nodes found along the way.  Callers
     * rely on this side-effect of clearing indices to deleted nodes.
     * @param key the key
     * @return a predecessor of key

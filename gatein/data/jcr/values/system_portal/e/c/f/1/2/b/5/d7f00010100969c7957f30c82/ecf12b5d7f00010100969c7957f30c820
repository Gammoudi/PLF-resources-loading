     * Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped,
     * or {@code null} if this map contains no mapping for the key.
     *
     * <p>More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key
     * {@code k} to a value {@code v} such that {@code key} compares
     * equal to {@code k} according to the map's ordering, then this
     * method returns {@code v}; otherwise it returns {@code null}.
     * (There can be at most one such mapping.)
     *
     * @throws ClassCastException if the specified key cannot be compared
     *         with the keys currently in the map
     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified key is null

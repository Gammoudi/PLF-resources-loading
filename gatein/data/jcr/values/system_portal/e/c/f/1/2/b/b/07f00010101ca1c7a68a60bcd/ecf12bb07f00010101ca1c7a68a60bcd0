     * Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map.  If this map
     * contains more than <tt>Integer.MAX_VALUE</tt> elements, it
     * returns <tt>Integer.MAX_VALUE</tt>.
     *
     * <p>Beware that, unlike in most collections, this method is
     * <em>NOT</em> a constant-time operation. Because of the
     * asynchronous nature of these maps, determining the current
     * number of elements requires traversing them all to count them.
     * Additionally, it is possible for the size to change during
     * execution of this method, in which case the returned result
     * will be inaccurate. Thus, this method is typically not very
     * useful in concurrent applications.
     *
     * @return the number of elements in this map

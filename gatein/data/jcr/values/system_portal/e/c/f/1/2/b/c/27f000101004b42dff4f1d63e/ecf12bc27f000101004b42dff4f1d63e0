     * Possibly reduce head level if it has no nodes.  This method can
     * (rarely) make mistakes, in which case levels can disappear even
     * though they are about to contain index nodes. This impacts
     * performance, not correctness.  To minimize mistakes as well as
     * to reduce hysteresis, the level is reduced by one only if the
     * topmost three levels look empty. Also, if the removed level
     * looks non-empty after CAS, we try to change it back quick
     * before anyone notices our mistake! (This trick works pretty
     * well because this method will practically never make mistakes
     * unless current thread stalls immediately before first CAS, in
     * which case it is very unlikely to stall again immediately
     * afterwards, so will recover.)
     *
     * We put up with all this rather than just let levels grow
     * because otherwise, even a small map that has undergone a large
     * number of insertions and removals will have a lot of levels,
     * slowing down access more than would an occasional unwanted
     * reduction.

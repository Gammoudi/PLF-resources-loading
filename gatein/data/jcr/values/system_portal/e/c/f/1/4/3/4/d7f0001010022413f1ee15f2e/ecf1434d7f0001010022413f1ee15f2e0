         * Returns true if this node is a marker. This method isn't
         * actually called in any current code checking for markers
         * because callers will have already read value field and need
         * to use that read (not another done here) and so directly
         * test if value points to node.
         * @param n a possibly null reference to a node
         * @return true if this node is a marker node

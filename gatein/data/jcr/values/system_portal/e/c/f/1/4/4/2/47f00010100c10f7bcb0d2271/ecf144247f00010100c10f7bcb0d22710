 Submaps returned by <a href='../java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentSkipListMap.html' title='ConcurrentSkipListMap'>ConcurrentSkipListMap</a> submap operations
 represent a subrange of mappings of their underlying
 maps. Instances of this class support all methods of their
 underlying maps, differing in that mappings outside their range are
 ignored, and attempts to add mappings outside their ranges result
 in java.lang.IllegalArgumentException.  Instances of this class are
 constructed only using the <tt>subMap</tt>, <tt>headMap</tt>, and
 <tt>tailMap</tt> methods of their underlying maps.<DL><DT><B>serial:</B></DT><DD>include</DD></DL>

     * Returns a view of the portion of this list between
     * <tt>fromIndex</tt>, inclusive, and <tt>toIndex</tt>, exclusive.
     * The returned list is backed by this list, so changes in the
     * returned list are reflected in this list, and vice-versa.
     * While mutative operations are supported, they are probably not
     * very useful for CopyOnWriteArrayLists.
     *
     * <p>The semantics of the list returned by this method become
     * undefined if the backing list (i.e., this list) is
     * <i>structurally modified</i> in any way other than via the
     * returned list.  (Structural modifications are those that change
     * the size of the list, or otherwise perturb it in such a fashion
     * that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)

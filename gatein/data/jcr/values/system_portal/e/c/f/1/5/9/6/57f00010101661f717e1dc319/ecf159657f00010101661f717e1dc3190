 Sublist for CopyOnWriteArrayList.
 This class extends AbstractList merely for convenience, to
 avoid having to define addAll, etc. This doesn't hurt, but
 is wasteful.  This class does not need or use modCount
 mechanics in AbstractList, but does need to check for
 concurrent modification using similar mechanics.  On each
 operation, the array that we expect the backing list to use
 is checked and updated.  Since we do this for all of the
 base operations invoked by those defined in AbstractList,
 all is well.  While inefficient, this is not worth
 improving.  The kinds of list operations inherited from
 AbstractList are already so slow on COW sublists that
 adding a bit more space/time doesn't seem even noticeable.

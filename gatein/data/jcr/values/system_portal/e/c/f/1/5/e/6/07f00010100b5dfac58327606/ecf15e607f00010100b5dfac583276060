     * Compares the specified object with this set for equality.
     * Returns {@code true} if the specified object is the same object
     * as this object, or if it is also a {@link Set} and the elements
     * returned by an {@linkplain List#iterator() iterator} over the
     * specified set are the same as the elements returned by an
     * iterator over this set.  More formally, the two iterators are
     * considered to return the same elements if they return the same
     * number of elements and for every element {@code e1} returned by
     * the iterator over the specified set, there is an element
     * {@code e2} returned by the iterator over this set such that
     * {@code (e1==null ? e2==null : e1.equals(e2))}.

     * @param o object to be compared for equality with this set
     * @return {@code true} if the specified object is equal to this set

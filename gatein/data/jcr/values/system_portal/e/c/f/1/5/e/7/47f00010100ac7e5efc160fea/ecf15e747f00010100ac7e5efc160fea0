     * Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set.
     * If this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
     * are returned by its iterator, this method must return the
     * elements in the same order.
     *
     * <p>The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it
     * are maintained by this set.  (In other words, this method must
     * allocate a new array even if this set is backed by an array).
     * The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.
     *
     * <p>This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
     * APIs.

 Each use of the barrier is represented as a generation instance.
 The generation changes whenever the barrier is tripped, or
 is reset. There can be many generations associated with threads
 using the barrier - due to the non-deterministic way the lock
 may be allocated to waiting threads - but only one of these
 can be active at a time (the one to which <tt>count</tt> applies)
 and all the rest are either broken or tripped.
 There need not be an active generation if there has been a break
 but no subsequent reset.

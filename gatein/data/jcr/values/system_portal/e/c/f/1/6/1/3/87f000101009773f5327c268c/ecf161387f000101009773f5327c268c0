 An unbounded {<DL><DT><B>linkplain:</B></DT><DD>BlockingQueue blocking queue} of
 <tt>Delayed</tt> elements, in which an element can only be taken
 when its delay has expired.  The <em>head</em> of the queue is that
 <tt>Delayed</tt> element whose delay expired furthest in the
 past.  If no delay has expired there is no head and <tt>poll</tt>
 will return <tt>null</tt>. Expiration occurs when an element's
 <tt>getDelay(TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS)</tt> method returns a value less
 than or equal to zero.  Even though unexpired elements cannot be
 removed using <tt>take</tt> or <tt>poll</tt>, they are otherwise
 treated as normal elements. For example, the <tt>size</tt> method
 returns the count of both expired and unexpired elements.
 This queue does not permit null elements.

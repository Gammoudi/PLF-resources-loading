     * Returns an iterator over all the elements (both expired and
     * unexpired) in this queue. The iterator does not return the
     * elements in any particular order.  The returned
     * <tt>Iterator</tt> is a "weakly consistent" iterator that will
     * never throw {@link ConcurrentModificationException}, and
     * guarantees to traverse elements as they existed upon
     * construction of the iterator, and may (but is not guaranteed
     * to) reflect any modifications subsequent to construction.

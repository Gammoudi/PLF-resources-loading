     * Returns an array containing all of the elements in this queue.
     * The returned array elements are in no particular order.
     *
     * <p>The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are
     * maintained by this queue.  (In other words, this method must allocate
     * a new array).  The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.
     *
     * <p>This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based
     * APIs.

     * Waits for another thread to arrive at this exchange point (unless
     * the current thread is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} or
     * the specified waiting time elapses), and then transfers the given
     * object to it, receiving its object in return.
     *
     * <p>If another thread is already waiting at the exchange point then
     * it is resumed for thread scheduling purposes and receives the object
     * passed in by the current thread.  The current thread returns immediately,
     * receiving the object passed to the exchange by that other thread.
     *
     * <p>If no other thread is already waiting at the exchange then the
     * current thread is disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies
     * dormant until one of three things happens:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Some other thread enters the exchange; or
     * <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupts}
     * the current thread; or
     * <li>The specified waiting time elapses.
     * </ul>
     * <p>If the current thread:
     * <ul>
     * <li>has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
     * <li>is {@linkplain Thread#interrupt interrupted} while waiting
     * for the exchange,
     * </ul>
     * then {@link InterruptedException} is thrown and the current thread's
     * interrupted status is cleared.
     *
     * <p>If the specified waiting time elapses then {@link
     * TimeoutException} is thrown.  If the time is less than or equal
     * to zero, the method will not wait at all.
     *
     * @param x the object to exchange
     * @param timeout the maximum time to wait
     * @param unit the time unit of the <tt>timeout</tt> argument
     * @return the object provided by the other thread
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread was
     *         interrupted while waiting
     * @throws TimeoutException if the specified waiting time elapses
     *         before another thread enters the exchange

     * Sweeps through arena checking for any waiting threads.  Called
     * only upon return from timeout while waiting in slot 0.  When a
     * thread gives up on a timed wait, it is possible that a
     * previously-entered thread is still waiting in some other
     * slot.  So we scan to check for any.  This is almost always
     * overkill, but decreases the likelihood of timeouts when there
     * are other threads present to far less than that in lock-based
     * exchangers in which earlier-arriving threads may still be
     * waiting on entry locks.

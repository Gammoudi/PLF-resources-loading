 A Slot is an AtomicReference with heuristic padding to lessen
 cache effects of this heavily CAS'ed location.  While the
 padding adds noticeable space, all slots are created only on
 demand, and there will be more than one of them only when it
 would improve throughput more than enough to outweigh using
 extra space.

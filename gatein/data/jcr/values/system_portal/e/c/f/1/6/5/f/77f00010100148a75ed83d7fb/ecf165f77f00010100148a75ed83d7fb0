     * Submits a value-returning task for execution and returns a
     * Future representing the pending results of the task. The
     * Future's <tt>get</tt> method will return the task's result upon
     * successful completion.
     *
     * <p>
     * If you would like to immediately block waiting
     * for a task, you can use constructions of the form
     * <tt>result = exec.submit(aCallable).get();</tt>
     *
     * <p> Note: The {@link Executors} class includes a set of methods
     * that can convert some other common closure-like objects,
     * for example, {@link java.security.PrivilegedAction} to
     * {@link Callable} form so they can be submitted.
     *
     * @param task the task to submit
     * @return a Future representing pending completion of the task
     * @throws RejectedExecutionException if the task cannot be
     *         scheduled for execution
     * @throws NullPointerException if the task is null

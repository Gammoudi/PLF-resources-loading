     * Returns an iterator over the elements in this queue. The
     * iterator does not return the elements in any particular order.
     * The returned <tt>Iterator</tt> is a "weakly consistent"
     * iterator that will never throw {@link
     * ConcurrentModificationException}, and guarantees to traverse
     * elements as they existed upon construction of the iterator, and
     * may (but is not guaranteed to) reflect any modifications
     * subsequent to construction.

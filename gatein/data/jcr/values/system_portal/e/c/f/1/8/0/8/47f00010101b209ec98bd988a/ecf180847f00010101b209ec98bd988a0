     * Implements the <tt>absolutePath</tt> method as per the specification in
     * {@link Preferences#absolutePath()}.
     *
     * <p>This implementation merely returns the absolute path name that
     * was computed at the time that this node was constructed (based on
     * the name that was passed to this node's constructor, and the names
     * that were passed to this node's ancestors' constructors).
     *
     * @return this preference node's absolute path name.

     * Implements the <tt>clear</tt> method as per the specification in
     * {@link Preferences#clear()}.
     *
     * <p>This implementation obtains this preference node's lock,
     * invokes {@link #keys()} to obtain an array of keys, and
     * iterates over the array invoking {@link #remove(String)} on each key.
     *
     * @throws BackingStoreException if this operation cannot be completed
     *         due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to 
     *         communicate with it.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this node (or an ancestor) has been
     *         removed with the {@link #removeNode()} method.

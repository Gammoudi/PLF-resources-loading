     *
     * @param key key whose associated value is to be returned as a byte array.
     * @param def the value to be returned in the event that this
     *        preference node has no value associated with <tt>key</tt>
     *        or the associated value cannot be interpreted as a byte array.
     * @return the byte array value represented by the string associated with
     *         <tt>key</tt> in this preference node, or <tt>def</tt> if the
     *         associated value does not exist or cannot be interpreted as
     *         a byte array.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this node (or an ancestor) has been
     *         removed with the {@link #removeNode()} method.
     * @throws NullPointerException if <tt>key</tt> is <tt>null</tt>.  (A 
     *         <tt>null</tt> value for <tt>def</tt> <i>is</i> permitted.)

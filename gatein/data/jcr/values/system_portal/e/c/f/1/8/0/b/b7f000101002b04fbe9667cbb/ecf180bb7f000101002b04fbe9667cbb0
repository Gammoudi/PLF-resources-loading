     * Implements the <tt>getDouble</tt> method as per the specification in
     * {@link Preferences#getDouble(String,double)}.
     *
     * <p>This implementation invokes {@link #get(String,String) <tt>get(key,
     * null)</tt>}.  If the return value is non-null, the implementation
     * attempts to translate it to an <tt>double</tt> with
     * {@link Double#parseDouble(String)}.  If the attempt succeeds, the return
     * value is returned by this method.  Otherwise, <tt>def</tt> is returned.
     *
     * @param key key whose associated value is to be returned as a double.
     * @param def the value to be returned in the event that this
     *        preference node has no value associated with <tt>key</tt>
     *        or the associated value cannot be interpreted as a double.
     * @return the double value represented by the string associated with
     *         <tt>key</tt> in this preference node, or <tt>def</tt> if the
     *         associated value does not exist or cannot be interpreted as
     *         a double.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this node (or an ancestor) has been
     *         removed with the {@link #removeNode()} method.
     * @throws NullPointerException if <tt>key</tt> is <tt>null</tt>.

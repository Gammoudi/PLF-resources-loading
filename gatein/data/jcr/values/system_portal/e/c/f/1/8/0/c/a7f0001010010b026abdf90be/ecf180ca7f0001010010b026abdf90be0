     * Implements the <tt>isUserNode</tt> method as per the specification in
     * {@link Preferences#isUserNode()}.
     *
     * <p>This implementation compares this node's root node (which is stored
     * in a private field) with the value returned by
     * {@link Preferences#userRoot()}.  If the two object references are
     * identical, this method returns true.
     *
     * @return <tt>true</tt> if this preference node is in the user
     *         preference tree, <tt>false</tt> if it's in the system
     *         preference tree.

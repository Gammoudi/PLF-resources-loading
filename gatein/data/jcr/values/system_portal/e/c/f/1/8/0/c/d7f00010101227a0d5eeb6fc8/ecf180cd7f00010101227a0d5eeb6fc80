     * {@link Preferences#keys()}.
     *

     * the node has not been removed and invokes {@link #keysSpi()}.
     *
     * @return an array of the keys that have an associated value in this
     *         preference node.
     * @throws BackingStoreException if this operation cannot be completed
     *         due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to 
     *         communicate with it.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this node (or an ancestor) has been
     *         removed with the {@link #removeNode()} method.

     * Implements the <tt>putDouble</tt> method as per the specification in
     * {@link Preferences#putDouble(String,double)}.
     *

     * {@link Double#toString(double)} and invokes {@link #put(String,String)}
     * on the result.
     *
     * @param key key with which the string form of value is to be associated.
     * @param value value whose string form is to be associated with key.
     * @throws NullPointerException if key is <tt>null</tt>.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if <tt>key.length()</tt> exceeds
     *         <tt>MAX_KEY_LENGTH</tt>.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this node (or an ancestor) has been
     *         removed with the {@link #removeNode()} method.

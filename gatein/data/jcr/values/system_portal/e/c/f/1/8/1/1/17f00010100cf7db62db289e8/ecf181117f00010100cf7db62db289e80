     * Implements the <tt>sync</tt> method as per the specification in
     * {@link Preferences#sync()}.
     *
     * <p>This implementation calls a recursive helper method that locks this
     * node, invokes syncSpi() on it, unlocks this node, and recursively
     * invokes this method on each "cached child."  A cached child is a child
     * of this node that has been created in this VM and not subsequently
     * removed.  In effect, this method does a depth first traversal of the
     * "cached subtree" rooted at this node, calling syncSpi() on each node in
     * the subTree while only that node is locked. Note that syncSpi() is
     * invoked top-down.
     *
     * @throws BackingStoreException if this operation cannot be completed
     *         due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to 
     *         communicate with it.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this node (or an ancestor) has been
     *         removed with the {@link #removeNode()} method.
     * @see #flush()

     * This method is invoked with this node locked.  The contract of this
     * method is to synchronize any cached preferences stored at this node
     * with any stored in the backing store.  (It is perfectly possible that
     * this node does not exist on the backing store, either because it has
     * been deleted by another VM, or because it has not yet been created.)
     * Note that this method should <i>not</i> synchronize the preferences in
     * any subnodes of this node.  If the backing store naturally syncs an
     * entire subtree at once, the implementer is encouraged to override
     * sync(), rather than merely overriding this method.
     *
     * <p>If this node throws a <tt>BackingStoreException</tt>, the exception
     * will propagate out beyond the enclosing {@link #sync()} invocation.
     *
     * @throws BackingStoreException if this operation cannot be completed
     *         due to a failure in the backing store, or inability to 
     *         communicate with it.

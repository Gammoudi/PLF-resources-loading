 Preferences implementation for Unix.  Preferences are stored in the file
 system, with one directory per preferences node.  All of the preferences
 at each node are stored in a single file.  Atomic file system operations
 (e.g. File.renameTo) are used to ensure integrity.  An in-memory cache of
 the "explored" portion of the tree is maintained for performance, and 
 written back to the disk periodically.  File-locking is used to ensure
 reasonable behavior when multiple VMs are running at the same time.
 (The file lock is obtained only for sync(), flush() and removeNode().)

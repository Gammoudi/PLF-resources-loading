     * Initialize prefsCache if it has yet to be initialized.  When this method
     * returns, prefsCache will be non-null.  If the data was successfully
     * read from the file, lastSyncTime will be updated.  If prefsCache was
     * null, but it was impossible to read the file (because it didn't
     * exist or for any other reason) prefsCache will be initialized to an
     * empty, modifiable Map, and lastSyncTime remain zero.

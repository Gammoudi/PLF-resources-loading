     * Attempt to load prefsCache from the backing store.  If the attempt
     * succeeds, lastSyncTime will be updated (the new value will typically
     * correspond to the data loaded into the map, but it may be less,
     * if another VM is updating this node concurrently).  If the attempt
     * fails, a BackingStoreException is thrown and both prefsCache and
     * lastSyncTime are unaffected by the call.

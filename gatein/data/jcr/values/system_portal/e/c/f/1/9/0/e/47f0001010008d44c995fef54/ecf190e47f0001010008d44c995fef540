     * Attempt to write back prefsCache to the backing store.  If the attempt
     * succeeds, lastSyncTime will be updated (the new value will correspond
     * exactly to the data thust written back, as we hold the file lock, which
     * prevents a concurrent write.  If the attempt fails, a
     * BackingStoreException is thrown and both the backing store (prefsFile)
     * and lastSyncTime will be unaffected by this call.  This call will
     * NEVER leave prefsFile in a corrupt state.

 The Attributes.Name class represents an attribute name stored in
 this Map. Valid attribute names are case-insensitive, are restricted 
 to the ASCII characters in the set [0-9a-zA-Z_-], and cannot exceed 
 70 characters in length. Attribute values can contain any characters 
 and will be UTF8-encoded when written to the output stream.  See the 
 <a href="../../../../technotes/guides/jar/jar.html">JAR File Specification</a> 
 for more information about valid attribute names and values.

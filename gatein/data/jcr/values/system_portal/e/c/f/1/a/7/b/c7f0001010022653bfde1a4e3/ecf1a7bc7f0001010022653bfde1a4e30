 The unpacker engine converts the packed stream to a JAR file.
 An instance of the engine can be obtained
 using <a href='#newUnpacker'>newUnpacker</a>.
 <p>
 Every JAR file produced by this engine will include the string
 "<tt>PACK200</tt>" as a zip file comment.
 This allows a deployer to detect if a JAR archive was packed and unpacked.
 <p>
 This version of the unpacker is compatible with all previous versions.

 This class provides a skeletal implementation of the <tt>Collection</tt>
 interface, to minimize the effort required to implement this interface. <p>

 To implement an unmodifiable collection, the programmer needs only to
 extend this class and provide implementations for the <tt>iterator</tt> and
 <tt>size</tt> methods.  (The iterator returned by the <tt>iterator</tt>
 method must implement <tt>hasNext</tt> and <tt>next</tt>.)<p>

 To implement a modifiable collection, the programmer must additionally
 override this class's <tt>add</tt> method (which otherwise throws an
 <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt>), and the iterator returned by the
 <tt>iterator</tt> method must additionally implement its <tt>remove</tt>
 method.<p>

 The programmer should generally provide a void (no argument) and
 <tt>Collection</tt> constructor, as per the recommendation in the
 <tt>Collection</tt> interface specification.<p>

 The documentation for each non-abstract method in this class describes its
 implementation in detail.  Each of these methods may be overridden if
 the collection being implemented admits a more efficient implementation.<p>

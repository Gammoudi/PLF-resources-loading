     * <p>This implementation iterates over this collection, removing each
     * element using the <tt>Iterator.remove</tt> operation.  Most
     * implementations will probably choose to override this method for
     * efficiency.
     *
     * <p>Note that this implementation will throw an
     * <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if the iterator returned by this
     * collection's <tt>iterator</tt> method does not implement the
     * <tt>remove</tt> method and this collection is non-empty.

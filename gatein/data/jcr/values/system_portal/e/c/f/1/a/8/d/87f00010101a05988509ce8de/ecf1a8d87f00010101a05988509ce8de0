     * <p>This implementation iterates over this collection, checking each
     * element returned by the iterator in turn to see if it's contained
     * in the specified collection.  If it's not so contained, it's removed
     * from this collection with the iterator's <tt>remove</tt> method.
     *
     * <p>Note that this implementation will throw an
     * <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if the iterator returned by the
     * <tt>iterator</tt> method does not implement the <tt>remove</tt> method
     * and this collection contains one or more elements not present in the
     * specified collection.

     * {@inheritDoc}
     *
     * <p>This implementation returns an array containing all the elements
     * returned by this collection's iterator, in the same order, stored in
     * consecutive elements of the array, starting with index {@code 0}.
     * The length of the returned array is equal to the number of elements
     * returned by the iterator, even if the size of this collection changes
     * during iteration, as might happen if the collection permits
     * concurrent modification during iteration.  The {@code size} method is
     * called only as an optimization hint; the correct result is returned
     * even if the iterator returns a different number of elements.
     *
     * <p>This method is equivalent to:
     *
     *  <pre> {@code
     * List<E> list = new ArrayList<E>(size());
     * for (E e : this)
     *     list.add(e);
     * return list.toArray();
     * }</pre>

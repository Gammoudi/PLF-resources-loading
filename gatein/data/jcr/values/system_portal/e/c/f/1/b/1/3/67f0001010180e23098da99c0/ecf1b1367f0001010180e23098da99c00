 Resizable-array implementation of the <tt>List</tt> interface.  Implements
 all optional list operations, and permits all elements, including
 <tt>null</tt>.  In addition to implementing the <tt>List</tt> interface,
 this class provides methods to manipulate the size of the array that is
 used internally to store the list.  (This class is roughly equivalent to
 <tt>Vector</tt>, except that it is unsynchronized.)<p>

 The <tt>size</tt>, <tt>isEmpty</tt>, <tt>get</tt>, <tt>set</tt>,
 <tt>iterator</tt>, and <tt>listIterator</tt> operations run in constant
 time.  The <tt>add</tt> operation runs in <i>amortized constant time</i>,
 that is, adding n elements requires O(n) time.  All of the other operations
 run in linear time (roughly speaking).  The constant factor is low compared
 to that for the <tt>LinkedList</tt> implementation.<p>

 Each <tt>ArrayList</tt> instance has a <i>capacity</i>.  The capacity is
 the size of the array used to store the elements in the list.  It is always
 at least as large as the list size.  As elements are added to an ArrayList,
 its capacity grows automatically.  The details of the growth policy are not
 specified beyond the fact that adding an element has constant amortized
 time cost.<p>

 An application can increase the capacity of an <tt>ArrayList</tt> instance
 before adding a large number of elements using the <tt>ensureCapacity</tt>
 operation.  This may reduce the amount of incremental reallocation.

 <p><strong>Note that this implementation is not synchronized.</strong>
 If multiple threads access an <tt>ArrayList</tt> instance concurrently,
 and at least one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it
 <i>must</i> be synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is
 any operation that adds or deletes one or more elements, or explicitly
 resizes the backing array; merely setting the value of an element is not
 a structural modification.)  This is typically accomplished by
 synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the list.

 If no such object exists, the list should be "wrapped" using the
 <a href='../java/util/Collections.html#synchronizedList' title='Collections.synchronizedList'>Collections.synchronizedList</a>
 method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental
 unsynchronized access to the list:<pre>
   List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList(...));</pre>

 <p>The iterators returned by this class's <tt>iterator</tt> and
 <tt>listIterator</tt> methods are <i>fail-fast</i>: if the list is
 structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way
 except through the iterator's own <tt>remove</tt> or <tt>add</tt> methods,
 the iterator will throw a <a href='../java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html' title='ConcurrentModificationException'>ConcurrentModificationException</a>.  Thus, in
 the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly,
 rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined
 time in the future.<p>

 Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
 Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 exception for its correctness: <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 should be used only to detect bugs.</i><p>

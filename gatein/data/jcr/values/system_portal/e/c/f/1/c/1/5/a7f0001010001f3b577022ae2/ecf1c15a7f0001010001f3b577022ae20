     * Converts the current millisecond time value {@link #time}
     * to calendar field values in {@link #fields fields[]}.
     * This allows you to sync up the calendar field values with
     * a new time that is set for the calendar.  The time is <em>not</em>
     * recomputed first; to recompute the time, then the fields, call the
     * {@link #complete()} method.

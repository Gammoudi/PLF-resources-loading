     * Returns the value of the given calendar field. In lenient mode,
     * all calendar fields are normalized. In non-lenient mode, all
     * calendar fields are validated and this method throws an
     * exception if any calendar fields have out-of-range values. The
     * normalization and validation are handled by the
     * {@link #complete()} method, which process is calendar
     * system dependent.

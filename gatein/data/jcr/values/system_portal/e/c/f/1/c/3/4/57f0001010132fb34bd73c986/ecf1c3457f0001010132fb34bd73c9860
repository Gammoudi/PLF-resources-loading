     * Adds the specified (signed) amount to the specified calendar field
     * without changing larger fields.  A negative amount means to roll
     * down.
     *
     * <p>NOTE:  This default implementation on <code>Calendar</code> just repeatedly calls the
     * version of {@link #roll(int,boolean) roll()} that rolls by one unit.  This may not
     * always do the right thing.  For example, if the <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code> field is 31,
     * rolling through February will leave it set to 28.  The <code>GregorianCalendar</code>
     * version of this function takes care of this problem.  Other subclasses
     * should also provide overrides of this function that do the right thing.
     *
     * @param field the calendar field.
     * @param amount the signed amount to add to the calendar <code>field</code>.

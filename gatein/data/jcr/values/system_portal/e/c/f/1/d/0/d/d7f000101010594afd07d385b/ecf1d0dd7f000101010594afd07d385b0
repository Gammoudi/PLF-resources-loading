     * Ensures that this collection contains the specified element (optional
     * operation).  Returns <tt>true</tt> if this collection changed as a
     * result of the call.  (Returns <tt>false</tt> if this collection does
     * not permit duplicates and already contains the specified element.)<p>
     *
     * Collections that support this operation may place limitations on what
     * elements may be added to this collection.  In particular, some
     * collections will refuse to add <tt>null</tt> elements, and others will
     * impose restrictions on the type of elements that may be added.
     * Collection classes should clearly specify in their documentation any
     * restrictions on what elements may be added.<p>
     *
     * If a collection refuses to add a particular element for any reason
     * other than that it already contains the element, it <i>must</i> throw
     * an exception (rather than returning <tt>false</tt>).  This preserves
     * the invariant that a collection always contains the specified element
     * after this call returns.

     * Compares the specified object with this collection for equality. <p>
     *
     * While the <tt>Collection</tt> interface adds no stipulations to the
     * general contract for the <tt>Object.equals</tt>, programmers who
     * implement the <tt>Collection</tt> interface "directly" (in other words,
     * create a class that is a <tt>Collection</tt> but is not a <tt>Set</tt>
     * or a <tt>List</tt>) must exercise care if they choose to override the
     * <tt>Object.equals</tt>.  It is not necessary to do so, and the simplest
     * course of action is to rely on <tt>Object</tt>'s implementation, but
     * the implementor may wish to implement a "value comparison" in place of
     * the default "reference comparison."  (The <tt>List</tt> and
     * <tt>Set</tt> interfaces mandate such value comparisons.)<p>
     *
     * The general contract for the <tt>Object.equals</tt> method states that
     * equals must be symmetric (in other words, <tt>a.equals(b)</tt> if and
     * only if <tt>b.equals(a)</tt>).  The contracts for <tt>List.equals</tt>
     * and <tt>Set.equals</tt> state that lists are only equal to other lists,
     * and sets to other sets.  Thus, a custom <tt>equals</tt> method for a
     * collection class that implements neither the <tt>List</tt> nor
     * <tt>Set</tt> interface must return <tt>false</tt> when this collection
     * is compared to any list or set.  (By the same logic, it is not possible
     * to write a class that correctly implements both the <tt>Set</tt> and
     * <tt>List</tt> interfaces.)

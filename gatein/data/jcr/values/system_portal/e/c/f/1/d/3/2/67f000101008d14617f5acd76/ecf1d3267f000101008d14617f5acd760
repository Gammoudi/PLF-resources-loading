 This class consists exclusively of static methods that operate on or return
 collections.  It contains polymorphic algorithms that operate on
 collections, "wrappers", which return a new collection backed by a
 specified collection, and a few other odds and ends.

 <p>The methods of this class all throw a <tt>NullPointerException</tt>
 if the collections or class objects provided to them are null.

 <p>The documentation for the polymorphic algorithms contained in this class
 generally includes a brief description of the <i>implementation</i>.  Such
 descriptions should be regarded as <i>implementation notes</i>, rather than
 parts of the <i>specification</i>.  Implementors should feel free to
 substitute other algorithms, so long as the specification itself is adhered
 to.  (For example, the algorithm used by <tt>sort</tt> does not have to be
 a mergesort, but it does have to be <i>stable</i>.)

 <p>The "destructive" algorithms contained in this class, that is, the
 algorithms that modify the collection on which they operate, are specified
 to throw <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt> if the collection does not
 support the appropriate mutation primitive(s), such as the <tt>set</tt>
 method.  These algorithms may, but are not required to, throw this
 exception if an invocation would have no effect on the collection.  For
 example, invoking the <tt>sort</tt> method on an unmodifiable list that is
 already sorted may or may not throw <tt>UnsupportedOperationException</tt>.

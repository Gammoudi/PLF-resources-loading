     * Adds all of the specified elements to the specified collection.
     * Elements to be added may be specified individually or as an array.
     * The behavior of this convenience method is identical to that of
     * <tt>c.addAll(Arrays.asList(elements))</tt>, but this method is likely
     * to run significantly faster under most implementations.
     *
     * <p>When elements are specified individually, this method provides a
     * convenient way to add a few elements to an existing collection:
     * <pre>
     *     Collections.addAll(flavors, "Peaches 'n Plutonium", "Rocky Racoon");
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param c the collection into which <tt>elements</tt> are to be inserted
     * @param elements the elements to insert into <tt>c</tt>
     * @return <tt>true</tt> if the collection changed as a result of the call
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if <tt>c</tt> does not support
     *         the <tt>add</tt> operation
     * @throws NullPointerException if <tt>elements</tt> contains one or more
     *         null values and <tt>c</tt> does not permit null elements, or
     *         if <tt>c</tt> or <tt>elements</tt> are <tt>null</tt>
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if some property of a value in
     *         <tt>elements</tt> prevents it from being added to <tt>c</tt>

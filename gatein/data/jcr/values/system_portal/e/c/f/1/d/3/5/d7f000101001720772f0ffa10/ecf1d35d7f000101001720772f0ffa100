     * Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified sorted map.  Any
     * attempt to insert a mapping whose key or value have the wrong type will
     * result in an immediate <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.  Similarly, any
     * attempt to modify the value currently associated with a key will result
     * in an immediate <tt>ClassCastException</tt>, whether the modification
     * is attempted directly through the map itself, or through a {@link
     * Map.Entry} instance obtained from the map's {@link Map#entrySet() entry
     * set} view.
     *
     * <p>Assuming a map contains no incorrectly typed keys or values
     * prior to the time a dynamically typesafe view is generated, and
     * that all subsequent access to the map takes place through the view
     * (or one of its collection views), it is <i>guaranteed</i> that the
     * map cannot contain an incorrectly typed key or value.
     *
     * <p>A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be
     * found in the documentation for the {@link #checkedCollection checkedCollection}
     * method.
     *
     * <p>The returned map will be serializable if the specified map is
     * serializable.

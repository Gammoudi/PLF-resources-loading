     * Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified sorted set.  Any
     * attempt to insert an element of the wrong type will result in an
     * immediate <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.  Assuming a sorted set contains
     * no incorrectly typed elements prior to the time a dynamically typesafe
     * view is generated, and that all subsequent access to the sorted set
     * takes place through the view, it is <i>guaranteed</i> that the sorted
     * set cannot contain an incorrectly typed element.
     *
     * <p>A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be
     * found in the documentation for the {@link #checkedCollection checkedCollection}
     * method.
     *
     * <p>The returned sorted set will be serializable if the specified sorted
     * set is serializable.

     * @param s the sorted set for which a dynamically typesafe view is to be

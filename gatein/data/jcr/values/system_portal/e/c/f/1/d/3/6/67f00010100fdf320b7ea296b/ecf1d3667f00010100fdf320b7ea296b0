     * Copies all of the elements from one list into another.  After the
     * operation, the index of each copied element in the destination list
     * will be identical to its index in the source list.  The destination
     * list must be at least as long as the source list.  If it is longer, the
     * remaining elements in the destination list are unaffected. <p>
     *
     * This method runs in linear time.
     *
     * @param  dest The destination list.
     * @param  src The source list.
     * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if the destination list is too small
     *         to contain the entire source List.
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the destination list's
     *         list-iterator does not support the <tt>set</tt> operation.

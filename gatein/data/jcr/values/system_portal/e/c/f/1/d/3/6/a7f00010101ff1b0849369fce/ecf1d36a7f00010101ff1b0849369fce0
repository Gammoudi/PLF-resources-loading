     * Returns <tt>true</tt> if the two specified collections have no
     * elements in common.
     *
     * <p>Care must be exercised if this method is used on collections that
     * do not comply with the general contract for <tt>Collection</tt>.
     * Implementations may elect to iterate over either collection and test
     * for containment in the other collection (or to perform any equivalent
     * computation).  If either collection uses a nonstandard equality test
     * (as does a {@link SortedSet} whose ordering is not <i>compatible with
     * equals</i>, or the key set of an {@link IdentityHashMap}), both
     * collections must use the same nonstandard equality test, or the
     * result of this method is undefined.
     *
     * <p>Note that it is permissible to pass the same collection in both
     * parameters, in which case the method will return true if and only if
     * the collection is empty.

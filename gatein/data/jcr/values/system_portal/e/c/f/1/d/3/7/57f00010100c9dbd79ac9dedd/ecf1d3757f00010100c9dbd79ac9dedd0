     * Returns the empty set (immutable).  This set is serializable.
     * Unlike the like-named field, this method is parameterized.
     *
     * <p>This example illustrates the type-safe way to obtain an empty set:
     * <pre>
     *     Set&lt;String&gt; s = Collections.emptySet();
     * </pre>
     * Implementation note:  Implementations of this method need not
     * create a separate <tt>Set</tt> object for each call.   Using this
     * method is likely to have comparable cost to using the like-named
     * field.  (Unlike this method, the field does not provide type safety.)

     * Returns the maximum element of the given collection, according to the
     * <i>natural ordering</i> of its elements.  All elements in the
     * collection must implement the <tt>Comparable</tt> interface.
     * Furthermore, all elements in the collection must be <i>mutually
     * comparable</i> (that is, <tt>e1.compareTo(e2)</tt> must not throw a
     * <tt>ClassCastException</tt> for any elements <tt>e1</tt> and
     * <tt>e2</tt> in the collection).<p>
     *
     * This method iterates over the entire collection, hence it requires
     * time proportional to the size of the collection.
     *
     * @param  coll the collection whose maximum element is to be determined.
     * @return the maximum element of the given collection, according
     *         to the <i>natural ordering</i> of its elements.
     * @throws ClassCastException if the collection contains elements that are
     *	       not <i>mutually comparable</i> (for example, strings and
     *         integers).
     * @throws NoSuchElementException if the collection is empty.

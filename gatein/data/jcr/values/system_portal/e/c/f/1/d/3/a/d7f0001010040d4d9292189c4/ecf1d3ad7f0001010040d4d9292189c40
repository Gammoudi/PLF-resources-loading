     * Returns the minimum element of the given collection, according to the
     * order induced by the specified comparator.  All elements in the
     * collection must be <i>mutually comparable</i> by the specified
     * comparator (that is, <tt>comp.compare(e1, e2)</tt> must not throw a
     * <tt>ClassCastException</tt> for any elements <tt>e1</tt> and
     * <tt>e2</tt> in the collection).<p>
     *
     * This method iterates over the entire collection, hence it requires
     * time proportional to the size of the collection.
     *
     * @param  coll the collection whose minimum element is to be determined.
     * @param  comp the comparator with which to determine the minimum element.
     *         A <tt>null</tt> value indicates that the elements' <i>natural
     *         ordering</i> should be used.
     * @return the minimum element of the given collection, according
     *         to the specified comparator.
     * @throws ClassCastException if the collection contains elements that are
     *	       not <i>mutually comparable</i> using the specified comparator.
     * @throws NoSuchElementException if the collection is empty.
     * @see Comparable

     * Returns a comparator that imposes the reverse of the <i>natural
     * ordering</i> on a collection of objects that implement the
     * <tt>Comparable</tt> interface.  (The natural ordering is the ordering
     * imposed by the objects' own <tt>compareTo</tt> method.)  This enables a
     * simple idiom for sorting (or maintaining) collections (or arrays) of
     * objects that implement the <tt>Comparable</tt> interface in
     * reverse-natural-order.  For example, suppose a is an array of
     * strings. Then: <pre>
     * 		Arrays.sort(a, Collections.reverseOrder());
     * </pre> sorts the array in reverse-lexicographic (alphabetical) order.<p>
     *
     * The returned comparator is serializable.

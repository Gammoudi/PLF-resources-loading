     * Returns a comparator that imposes the reverse ordering of the specified
     * comparator.  If the specified comparator is null, this method is
     * equivalent to {@link #reverseOrder()} (in other words, it returns a
     * comparator that imposes the reverse of the <i>natural ordering</i> on a
     * collection of objects that implement the Comparable interface).
     *
     * <p>The returned comparator is serializable (assuming the specified
     * comparator is also serializable or null).
     *
     * @return a comparator that imposes the reverse ordering of the
     *     specified comparator.

     * Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) map backed by the specified
     * map.  In order to guarantee serial access, it is critical that
     * <strong>all</strong> access to the backing map is accomplished
     * through the returned map.<p>
     *
     * It is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned
     * map when iterating over any of its collection views:
     * <pre>
     *  Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap());
     *      ...
     *  Set s = m.keySet();  // Needn't be in synchronized block
     *      ...
     *  synchronized(m) {  // Synchronizing on m, not s!
     *      Iterator i = s.iterator(); // Must be in synchronized block
     *      while (i.hasNext())
     *          foo(i.next());
     *  }
     * </pre>
     * Failure to follow this advice may result in non-deterministic behavior.
     *
     * <p>The returned map will be serializable if the specified map is
     * serializable.
     *
     * @param  m the map to be "wrapped" in a synchronized map.
     * @return a synchronized view of the specified map.

     * Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) set backed by the specified
     * set.  In order to guarantee serial access, it is critical that
     * <strong>all</strong> access to the backing set is accomplished
     * through the returned set.<p>
     *
     * It is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned
     * set when iterating over it:
     * <pre>
     *  Set s = Collections.synchronizedSet(new HashSet());
     *      ...
     *  synchronized(s) {
     *      Iterator i = s.iterator(); // Must be in the synchronized block
     *      while (i.hasNext())
     *          foo(i.next());
     *  }
     * </pre>
     * Failure to follow this advice may result in non-deterministic behavior.
     *
     * <p>The returned set will be serializable if the specified set is
     * serializable.
     *
     * @param  s the set to be "wrapped" in a synchronized set.
     * @return a synchronized view of the specified set.

         * SynchronizedRandomAccessList instances are serialized as
         * SynchronizedList instances to allow them to be deserialized
         * in pre-1.4 JREs (which do not have SynchronizedRandomAccessList).
         * This method inverts the transformation.  As a beneficial
         * side-effect, it also grafts the RandomAccess marker onto
         * SynchronizedList instances that were serialized in pre-1.4 JREs.
         *
         * Note: Unfortunately, SynchronizedRandomAccessList instances
         * serialized in 1.4.1 and deserialized in 1.4 will become
         * SynchronizedList instances, as this method was missing in 1.4.

         * UnmodifiableRandomAccessList instances are serialized as
         * UnmodifiableList instances to allow them to be deserialized
         * in pre-1.4 JREs (which do not have UnmodifiableRandomAccessList).
         * This method inverts the transformation.  As a beneficial
         * side-effect, it also grafts the RandomAccess marker onto
         * UnmodifiableList instances that were serialized in pre-1.4 JREs.
         *
         * Note: Unfortunately, UnmodifiableRandomAccessList instances
         * serialized in 1.4.1 and deserialized in 1.4 will become
         * UnmodifiableList instances, as this method was missing in 1.4.

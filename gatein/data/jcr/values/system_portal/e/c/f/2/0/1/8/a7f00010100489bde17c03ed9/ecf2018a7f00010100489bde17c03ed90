     * Inserts the specified element into the queue represented by this deque
     * (in other words, at the tail of this deque) if it is possible to do so
     * immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning
     * <tt>true</tt> upon success and throwing an
     * <tt>IllegalStateException</tt> if no space is currently available.
     * When using a capacity-restricted deque, it is generally preferable to
     * use {@link #offer(Object) offer}.
     *
     * <p>This method is equivalent to {@link #addLast}.

     * @param e the element to add
     * @return <tt>true</tt> (as specified by {@link Collection#add})
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the element cannot be added at this
     *         time due to capacity restrictions
     * @throws ClassCastException if the class of the specified element
     *         prevents it from being added to this deque
     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified element is null and this
     *         deque does not permit null elements
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if some property of the specified
     *         element prevents it from being added to this deque

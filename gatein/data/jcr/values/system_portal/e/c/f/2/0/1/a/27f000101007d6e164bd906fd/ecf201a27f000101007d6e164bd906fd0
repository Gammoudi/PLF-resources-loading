     * Inserts the specified element into the queue represented by this deque
     * (in other words, at the tail of this deque) if it is possible to do so
     * immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning
     * <tt>true</tt> upon success and <tt>false</tt> if no space is currently
     * available.  When using a capacity-restricted deque, this method is
     * generally preferable to the {@link #add} method, which can fail to
     * insert an element only by throwing an exception.
     *
     * <p>This method is equivalent to {@link #offerLast}.

     * @param e the element to add
     * @return <tt>true</tt> if the element was added to this deque, else
     *         <tt>false</tt>
     * @throws ClassCastException if the class of the specified element
     *         prevents it from being added to this deque
     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified element is null and this
     *         deque does not permit null elements
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if some property of the specified
     *         element prevents it from being added to this deque

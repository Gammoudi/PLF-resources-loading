     * Inserts the specified element at the front of this deque unless it would
     * violate capacity restrictions.  When using a capacity-restricted deque,
     * this method is generally preferable to the {@link #addFirst} method,
     * which can fail to insert an element only by throwing an exception.
     *
     * @param e the element to add
     * @return <tt>true</tt> if the element was added to this deque, else
     *         <tt>false</tt>
     * @throws ClassCastException if the class of the specified element
     *         prevents it from being added to this deque
     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified element is null and this
     *         deque does not permit null elements
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if some property of the specified
     *         element prevents it from being added to this deque

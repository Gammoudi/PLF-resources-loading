     * Pushes an element onto the stack represented by this deque (in other
     * words, at the head of this deque) if it is possible to do so
     * immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning
     * <tt>true</tt> upon success and throwing an
     * <tt>IllegalStateException</tt> if no space is currently available.
     *
     * <p>This method is equivalent to {@link #addFirst}.

     * @throws ClassCastException if the class of the specified element
     *         prevents it from being added to this deque
     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified element is null and this
     *         deque does not permit null elements
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if some property of the specified

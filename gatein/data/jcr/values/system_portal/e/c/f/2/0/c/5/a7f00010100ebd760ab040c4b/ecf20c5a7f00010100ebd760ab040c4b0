     * Creates an enum set initially containing the specified elements.
     *
     * Overloadings of this method exist to initialize an enum set with
     * one through five elements.  A sixth overloading is provided that
     * uses the varargs feature.  This overloading may be used to create
     * an enum set initially containing an arbitrary number of elements, but
     * is likely to run slower than the overloadings that do not use varargs.
     *
     * @param e1 an element that this set is to contain initially
     * @param e2 another element that this set is to contain initially
     * @param e3 another element that this set is to contain initially
     * @throws NullPointerException if any parameters are null
     * @return an enum set initially containing the specified elements

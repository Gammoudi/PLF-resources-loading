 This class is used to serialize all EnumSet instances, regardless of
 implementation type.  It captures their "logical contents" and they
 are reconstructed using public static factories.  This is necessary
 to ensure that the existence of a particular implementation type is
 an implementation detail.<DL><DT><B>serial:</B></DT><DD>include</DD></DL>

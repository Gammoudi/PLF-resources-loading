     * Writes a formatted string to this object's destination using the
     * specified locale, format string, and arguments.
     *
     * @param  l
     *         The {@linkplain java.util.Locale locale} to apply during
     *         formatting.  If <tt>l</tt> is <tt>null</tt> then no localization
     *         is applied.  This does not change this object's locale that was
     *         set during construction.
     *
     * @param  format
     *         A format string as described in <a href="#syntax">Format string
     *         syntax</a>
     *
     * @param  args
     *         Arguments referenced by the format specifiers in the format
     *         string.  If there are more arguments than format specifiers, the
     *         extra arguments are ignored.  The maximum number of arguments is
     *         limited by the maximum dimension of a Java array as defined by
     *         the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/">Java
     *         Virtual Machine Specification</a>
     *
     * @throws  IllegalFormatException
     *          If a format string contains an illegal syntax, a format
     *          specifier that is incompatible with the given arguments,
     *          insufficient arguments given the format string, or other
     *          illegal conditions.  For specification of all possible
     *          formatting errors, see the <a href="#detail">Details</a>
     *          section of the formatter class specification.
     *
     * @throws  FormatterClosedException
     *          If this formatter has been closed by invoking its {@link
     *          #close()} method
     *
     * @return  This formatter

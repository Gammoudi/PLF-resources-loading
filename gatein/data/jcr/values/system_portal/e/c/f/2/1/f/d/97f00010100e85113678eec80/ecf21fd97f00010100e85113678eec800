     * This computeFields implements the conversion from UTC
     * (millisecond offset from the Epoch) to calendar
     * field values. fieldMask specifies which fields to change the
     * setting state to COMPUTED, although all fields are set to
     * the correct values. This is required to fix 4685354.
     *
     * @param fieldMask a bit mask to specify which fields to change
     * the setting state.
     * @param tzMask a bit mask to specify which time zone offset
     * fields to be used for time calculations
     * @return a new field mask that indicates what field values have
     * actually been set.

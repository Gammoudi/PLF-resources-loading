     * Adds a signed amount to the specified calendar field without changing larger fields.
     * A negative roll amount means to subtract from field without changing 
     * larger fields. If the specified amount is 0, this method performs nothing.
     *
     * <p>This method calls {@link #complete()} before adding the
     * amount so that all the calendar fields are normalized. If there
     * is any calendar field having an out-of-range value in non-lenient mode, then an
     * <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> is thrown.
     *
     * <p>
     * <em>Example</em>: Consider a <code>GregorianCalendar</code>
     * originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling <code>roll(Calendar.MONTH,
     * 8)</code> sets the calendar to April 30, <strong>1999</strong>. Using a
     * <code>GregorianCalendar</code>, the <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code> field cannot
     * be 31 in the month April. <code>DAY_OF_MONTH</code> is set to the closest possible
     * value, 30. The <code>YEAR</code> field maintains the value of 1999 because it
     * is a larger field than <code>MONTH</code>.
     * <p>
     * <em>Example</em>: Consider a <code>GregorianCalendar</code>
     * originally set to Sunday June 6, 1999. Calling
     * <code>roll(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)</code> sets the calendar to
     * Tuesday June 1, 1999, whereas calling
     * <code>add(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1)</code> sets the calendar to
     * Sunday May 30, 1999. This is because the roll rule imposes an
     * additional constraint: The <code>MONTH</code> must not change when the
     * <code>WEEK_OF_MONTH</code> is rolled. Taken together with add rule 1,
     * the resultant date must be between Tuesday June 1 and Saturday June
     * 5. According to add rule 2, the <code>DAY_OF_WEEK</code>, an invariant
     * when changing the <code>WEEK_OF_MONTH</code>, is set to Tuesday, the
     * closest possible value to Sunday (where Sunday is the first day of the
     * week).</p>

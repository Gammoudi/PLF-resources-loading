     * 
     * Removes from the underlying collection the last element returned by the
     * iterator (optional operation).  This method can be called only once per
     * call to <tt>next</tt>.  The behavior of an iterator is unspecified if
     * the underlying collection is modified while the iteration is in
     * progress in any way other than by calling this method.
     *
     * @exception UnsupportedOperationException if the <tt>remove</tt>
     *		  operation is not supported by this Iterator.
     
     * @exception IllegalStateException if the <tt>next</tt> method has not
     *		  yet been called, or the <tt>remove</tt> method has already
     *		  been called after the last call to the <tt>next</tt>
     *		  method.

     * Returns an iterator over the elements contained in this set.  The
     * iterator traverses the elements in their <i>natural order</i> (which is
     * the order in which the enum constants are declared). The returned
     * Iterator is a "weakly consistent" iterator that will never throw {@link
     * ConcurrentModificationException}.

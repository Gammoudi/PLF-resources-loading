     * Compares the specified object with this list for equality.  Returns
     * <tt>true</tt> if and only if the specified object is also a list, both
     * lists have the same size, and all corresponding pairs of elements in
     * the two lists are <i>equal</i>.  (Two elements <tt>e1</tt> and
     * <tt>e2</tt> are <i>equal</i> if <tt>(e1==null ? e2==null :
     * e1.equals(e2))</tt>.)  In other words, two lists are defined to be
     * equal if they contain the same elements in the same order.  This
     * definition ensures that the equals method works properly across
     * different implementations of the <tt>List</tt> interface.

     * @param o the object to be compared for equality with this list

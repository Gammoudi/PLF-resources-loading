     * Returns a view of the portion of this list between the specified
     * <tt>fromIndex</tt>, inclusive, and <tt>toIndex</tt>, exclusive.  (If
     * <tt>fromIndex</tt> and <tt>toIndex</tt> are equal, the returned list is
     * empty.)  The returned list is backed by this list, so non-structural
     * changes in the returned list are reflected in this list, and vice-versa.
     * The returned list supports all of the optional list operations supported
     * by this list.<p>
     *
     * This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of
     * the sort that commonly exist for arrays).   Any operation that expects
     * a list can be used as a range operation by passing a subList view
     * instead of a whole list.  For example, the following idiom
     * removes a range of elements from a list:
     * <pre>
     *      list.subList(from, to).clear();
     * </pre>
     * Similar idioms may be constructed for <tt>indexOf</tt> and
     * <tt>lastIndexOf</tt>, and all of the algorithms in the
     * <tt>Collections</tt> class can be applied to a subList.<p>
     *
     * The semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if
     * the backing list (i.e., this list) is <i>structurally modified</i> in
     * any way other than via the returned list.  (Structural modifications are
     * those that change the size of this list, or otherwise perturb it in such
     * a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)

     * @param fromIndex low endpoint (inclusive) of the subList
     * @param toIndex high endpoint (exclusive) of the subList
     * @return a view of the specified range within this list
     * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException for an illegal endpoint index value
     *         (<tt>fromIndex &lt; 0 || toIndex &gt; size ||

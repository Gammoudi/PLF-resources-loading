     * Returns the next element in the list.  This method may be called
     * repeatedly to iterate through the list, or intermixed with calls to
     * <tt>previous</tt> to go back and forth.  (Note that alternating calls
     * to <tt>next</tt> and <tt>previous</tt> will return the same element
     * repeatedly.)
     *
     * @return the next element in the list.
     * @exception NoSuchElementException if the iteration has no next element.

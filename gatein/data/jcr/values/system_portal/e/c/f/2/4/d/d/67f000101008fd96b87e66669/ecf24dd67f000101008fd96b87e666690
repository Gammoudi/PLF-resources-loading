     * Returns the previous element in the list.  This method may be called
     * repeatedly to iterate through the list backwards, or intermixed with
     * calls to <tt>next</tt> to go back and forth.  (Note that alternating
     * calls to <tt>next</tt> and <tt>previous</tt> will return the same
     * element repeatedly.)
     *
     * @return the previous element in the list.
     *
     * @exception NoSuchElementException if the iteration has no previous
     *            element.

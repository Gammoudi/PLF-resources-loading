     * Returns a name for the locale's country that is appropriate for display to the
     * user.
     * If possible, the name returned will be localized according to inLocale.
     * For example, if the locale is fr_FR and inLocale
     * is en_US, getDisplayCountry() will return "France"; if the locale is en_US and
     * inLocale is fr_FR, getDisplayCountry() will return "Etats-Unis".
     * If the name returned cannot be localized according to inLocale.
     * (say, we don't have a Japanese name for Croatia),
     * this function falls back on the English name, and finally
     * on the ISO code as a last-resort value.  If the locale doesn't specify a country,
     * this function returns the empty string.

     * @exception NullPointerException if <code>inLocale</code> is <code>null</code>

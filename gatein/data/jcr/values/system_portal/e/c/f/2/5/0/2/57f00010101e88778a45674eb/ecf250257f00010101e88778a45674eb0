     * Returns a name for the locale's language that is appropriate for display to the
     * user.
     * If possible, the name returned will be localized for the default locale.
     * For example, if the locale is fr_FR and the default locale
     * is en_US, getDisplayLanguage() will return "French"; if the locale is en_US and
     * the default locale is fr_FR, getDisplayLanguage() will return "anglais".
     * If the name returned cannot be localized for the default locale,
     * (say, we don't have a Japanese name for Croatian),
     * this function falls back on the English name, and uses the ISO code as a last-resort
     * value.  If the locale doesn't specify a language, this function returns the empty string.

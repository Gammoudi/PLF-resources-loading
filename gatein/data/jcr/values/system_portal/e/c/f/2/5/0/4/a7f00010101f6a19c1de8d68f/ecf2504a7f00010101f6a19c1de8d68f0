     * Returns the language code for this locale, which will either be the empty string
     * or a lowercase ISO 639 code.
     * <p>NOTE:  ISO 639 is not a stable standard-- some languages' codes have changed.
     * Locale's constructor recognizes both the new and the old codes for the languages
     * whose codes have changed, but this function always returns the old code.  If you 
     * want to check for a specific language whose code has changed, don't do <pre> 
     * if (locale.getLanguage().equals("he")) 
     *    ... 
     * </pre>Instead, do<pre> 
     * if (locale.getLanguage().equals(new Locale("he", "", "").getLanguage())) 
     *    ...</pre>

     * Getter for the programmatic name of the entire locale,
     * with the language, country and variant separated by underbars.
     * Language is always lower case, and country is always upper case.
     * If the language is missing, the string will begin with an underbar.
     * If both the language and country fields are missing, this function
     * will return the empty string, even if the variant field is filled in
     * (you can't have a locale with just a variant-- the variant must accompany
     * a valid language or country code).
     * Examples: "en", "de_DE", "_GB", "en_US_WIN", "de__POSIX", "fr__MAC"
     * @see #getDisplayName

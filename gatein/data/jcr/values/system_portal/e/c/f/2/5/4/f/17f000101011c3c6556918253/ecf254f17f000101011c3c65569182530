     * Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped,
     * or {@code null} if this map contains no mapping for the key.
     *
     * <p>More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key
     * {@code k} to a value {@code v} such that {@code (key==null ? k==null :
     * key.equals(k))}, then this method returns {@code v}; otherwise
     * it returns {@code null}.  (There can be at most one such mapping.)
     *
     * <p>If this map permits null values, then a return value of
     * {@code null} does not <i>necessarily</i> indicate that the map
     * contains no mapping for the key; it's also possible that the map
     * explicitly maps the key to {@code null}.  The {@link #containsKey
     * containsKey} operation may be used to distinguish these two cases.
     *
     * @param key the key whose associated value is to be returned
     * @return the value to which the specified key is mapped, or
     *         {@code null} if this map contains no mapping for the key
     * @throws ClassCastException if the key is of an inappropriate type for
     *         this map (optional)
     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified key is null and this map
     *         does not permit null keys (optional)

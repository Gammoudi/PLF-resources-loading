     * Returns the hash code value for this map.  The hash code of a map is
     * defined to be the sum of the hash codes of each entry in the map's
     * <tt>entrySet()</tt> view.  This ensures that <tt>m1.equals(m2)</tt>
     * implies that <tt>m1.hashCode()==m2.hashCode()</tt> for any two maps
     * <tt>m1</tt> and <tt>m2</tt>, as required by the general contract of
     * {@link Object#hashCode}.

     * Copies all of the mappings from the specified map to this map
     * (optional operation).  The effect of this call is equivalent to that
     * of calling {@link #put(Object,Object) put(k, v)} on this map once
     * for each mapping from key <tt>k</tt> to value <tt>v</tt> in the
     * specified map.  The behavior of this operation is undefined if the
     * specified map is modified while the operation is in progress.

     *         is not supported by this map
     * @throws ClassCastException if the class of a key or value in the
     *         specified map prevents it from being stored in this map
     * @throws NullPointerException if the specified map is null, or if
     *         this map does not permit null keys or values, and the
     *         specified map contains null keys or values
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if some property of a key or value in

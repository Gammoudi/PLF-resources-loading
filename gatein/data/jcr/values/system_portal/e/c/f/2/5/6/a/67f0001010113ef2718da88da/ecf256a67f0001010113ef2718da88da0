 A map entry (key-value pair).  The <tt>Map.entrySet</tt> method returns
 a collection-view of the map, whose elements are of this class.  The
 <i>only</i> way to obtain a reference to a map entry is from the
 iterator of this collection-view.  These <tt>Map.Entry</tt> objects are
 valid <i>only</i> for the duration of the iteration; more formally,
 the behavior of a map entry is undefined if the backing map has been
 modified after the entry was returned by the iterator, except through
 the <tt>setValue</tt> operation on the map entry.

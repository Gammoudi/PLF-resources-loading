     * Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys are greater than (or
     * equal to, if {@code inclusive} is true) {@code fromKey}.  The returned
     * map is backed by this map, so changes in the returned map are reflected
     * in this map, and vice-versa.  The returned map supports all optional
     * map operations that this map supports.
     *
     * <p>The returned map will throw an {@code IllegalArgumentException}
     * on an attempt to insert a key outside its range.
     *
     * @param fromKey low endpoint of the keys in the returned map
     * @param inclusive {@code true} if the low endpoint
     *        is to be included in the returned view
     * @return a view of the portion of this map whose keys are greater than
     *         (or equal to, if {@code inclusive} is true) {@code fromKey}
     * @throws ClassCastException if {@code fromKey} is not compatible
     *         with this map's comparator (or, if the map has no comparator,
     *         if {@code fromKey} does not implement {@link Comparable}).
     *         Implementations may, but are not required to, throw this
     *         exception if {@code fromKey} cannot be compared to keys
     *         currently in the map.
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code fromKey} is null
     *         and this map does not permit null keys
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if this map itself has a
     *         restricted range, and {@code fromKey} lies outside the
     *         bounds of the range

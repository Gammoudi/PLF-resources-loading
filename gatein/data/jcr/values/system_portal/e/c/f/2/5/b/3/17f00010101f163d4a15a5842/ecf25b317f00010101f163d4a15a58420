     * Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are less than
     * (or equal to, if {@code inclusive} is true) {@code toElement}.  The
     * returned set is backed by this set, so changes in the returned set are
     * reflected in this set, and vice-versa.  The returned set supports all
     * optional set operations that this set supports.
     *
     * <p>The returned set will throw an {@code IllegalArgumentException}
     * on an attempt to insert an element outside its range.
     *
     * @param toElement high endpoint of the returned set
     * @param inclusive {@code true} if the high endpoint
     *        is to be included in the returned view
     * @return a view of the portion of this set whose elements are less than
     *         (or equal to, if {@code inclusive} is true) {@code toElement}
     * @throws ClassCastException if {@code toElement} is not compatible
     *         with this set's comparator (or, if the set has no comparator,
     *         if {@code toElement} does not implement {@link Comparable}).
     *         Implementations may, but are not required to, throw this
     *         exception if {@code toElement} cannot be compared to elements
     *         currently in the set.
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code toElement} is null and
     *         this set does not permit null elements
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if this set itself has a
     *         restricted range, and {@code toElement} lies outside the
     *         bounds of the range

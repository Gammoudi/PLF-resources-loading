 <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code> is a concrete subclass of
 <code>ResourceBundle</code> that manages resources for a locale
 using a set of static strings from a property file. See
 <a href='../java/util/ResourceBundle.html' title='ResourceBundle'>ResourceBundle</a> for more information about resource
 bundles. 

 <p>
 Unlike other types of resource bundle, you don't subclass
 <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code>.  Instead, you supply properties
 files containing the resource data.  <code>ResourceBundle.getBundle</code>
 will automatically look for the appropriate properties file and create a
 <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code> that refers to it. See
 <a href='../ResourceBundle.html#getBundle(java.lang.String, java.util.Locale, java.lang.ClassLoader)' title='ResourceBundle.getBundle'>ResourceBundle.getBundle</a>
 for a complete description of the search and instantiation strategy.

 <p>
 The following <a name="sample">example</a> shows a member of a resource
 bundle family with the base name "MyResources".
 The text defines the bundle "MyResources_de",
 the German member of the bundle family.
 This member is based on <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code>, and the text
 therefore is the content of the file "MyResources_de.properties"
 (a related <a href="ListResourceBundle.html#sample">example</a> shows
 how you can add bundles to this family that are implemented as subclasses
 of <code>ListResourceBundle</code>).
 The keys in this example are of the form "s1" etc. The actual
 keys are entirely up to your choice, so long as they are the same as
 the keys you use in your program to retrieve the objects from the bundle.
 Keys are case-sensitive.
 <blockquote>
 <pre>
 # MessageFormat pattern
 s1=Die Platte \"{1}\" enth&auml;lt {0}.

 # location of {0} in pattern
 s2=1

 # sample disk name
 s3=Meine Platte

 # first ChoiceFormat choice
 s4=keine Dateien

 # second ChoiceFormat choice
 s5=eine Datei

 # third ChoiceFormat choice
 s6={0,number} Dateien

 # sample date
 s7=3. M&auml;rz 1996
 </pre>
 </blockquote>

 <p>
 <strong>Note:</strong> PropertyResourceBundle can be constructed either 
 from an InputStream or a Reader, which represents a property file.  
 Constructing a PropertyResourceBundle instance from an InputStream requires 
 that the input stream be encoded in ISO-8859-1.  In that case, characters 
 that cannot be represented in ISO-8859-1 encoding must be represented by 
 <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/lexical.html#3.3">Unicode Escapes</a>, 
 whereas the other constructor which takes a Reader does not have that limitation.

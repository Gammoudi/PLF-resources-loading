     * Creates a new service loader for the given service type, using the
     * extension class loader.
     *
     * <p> This convenience method simply locates the extension class loader,
     * call it <tt><i>extClassLoader</i></tt>, and then returns
     *
     * <blockquote><pre>
     * ServiceLoader.load(<i>service</i>, <i>extClassLoader</i>)</pre></blockquote>
     *
     * <p> If the extension class loader cannot be found then the system class
     * loader is used; if there is no system class loader then the bootstrap
     * class loader is used.
     *
     * <p> This method is intended for use when only installed providers are
     * desired.  The resulting service will only find and load providers that
     * have been installed into the current Java virtual machine; providers on
     * the application's class path will be ignored.
     *
     * @param  service
     *         The interface or abstract class representing the service
     *
     * @return A new service loader

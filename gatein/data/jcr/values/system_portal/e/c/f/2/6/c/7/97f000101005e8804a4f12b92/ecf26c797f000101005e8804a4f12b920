     * Clear this loader's provider cache so that all providers will be
     * reloaded.
     *
     * <p> After invoking this method, subsequent invocations of the {@link
     * #iterator() iterator} method will lazily look up and instantiate
     * providers from scratch, just as is done by a newly-created loader.
     *
     * <p> This method is intended for use in situations in which new providers
     * can be installed into a running Java virtual machine.

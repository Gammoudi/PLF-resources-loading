     * Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are
     * greater than or equal to <tt>fromElement</tt>.  The returned
     * set is backed by this set, so changes in the returned set are
     * reflected in this set, and vice-versa.  The returned set
     * supports all optional set operations that this set supports.
     *
     * <p>The returned set will throw an <tt>IllegalArgumentException</tt>
     * on an attempt to insert an element outside its range.
     *
     * @param fromElement low endpoint (inclusive) of the returned set
     * @return a view of the portion of this set whose elements are greater
     *         than or equal to <tt>fromElement</tt>
     * @throws ClassCastException if <tt>fromElement</tt> is not compatible
     *         with this set's comparator (or, if the set has no comparator,
     *         if <tt>fromElement</tt> does not implement {@link Comparable}).
     *         Implementations may, but are not required to, throw this
     *         exception if <tt>fromElement</tt> cannot be compared to elements
     *         currently in the set.
     * @throws NullPointerException if <tt>fromElement</tt> is null
     *         and this set does not permit null elements
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if this set itself has a
     *         restricted range, and <tt>fromElement</tt> lies outside the
     *         bounds of the range

 This class represents a timer task queue: a priority queue of TimerTasks,
 ordered on nextExecutionTime.  Each Timer object has one of these, which it
 shares with its TimerThread.  Internally this class uses a heap, which
 offers log(n) performance for the add, removeMin and rescheduleMin
 operations, and constant time performance for the getMin operation.

     * Returns the amount of time to be added to local standard time
     * to get local wall clock time.
     * <p>
     * The default implementation always returns 3600000 milliseconds
     * (i.e., one hour) if this time zone observes Daylight Saving
     * Time. Otherwise, 0 (zero) is returned.
     * <p>
     * If an underlying TimeZone implementation subclass supports
     * historical Daylight Saving Time changes, this method returns
     * the known latest daylight saving value.

     * @return the amount of saving time in milliseconds

     * Returns the amount of time in milliseconds to add to UTC to get
     * standard time in this time zone. Because this value is not
     * affected by daylight saving time, it is called <I>raw
     * offset</I>.
     * <p>
     * If an underlying <code>TimeZone</code> implementation subclass
     * supports historical GMT offset changes, the method returns the
     * raw offset value of the current date. In Honolulu, for example,
     * its raw offset changed from GMT-10:30 to GMT-10:00 in 1947, and
     * this method always returns -36000000 milliseconds (i.e., -10
     * hours).

     * @return the amount of raw offset time in milliseconds to add to UTC.

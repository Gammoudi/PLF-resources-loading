 A facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a
 background thread.  Tasks may be scheduled for one-time execution, or for
 repeated execution at regular intervals.

 <p>Corresponding to each <tt>Timer</tt> object is a single background
 thread that is used to execute all of the timer's tasks, sequentially.
 Timer tasks should complete quickly.  If a timer task takes excessive time
 to complete, it "hogs" the timer's task execution thread.  This can, in
 turn, delay the execution of subsequent tasks, which may "bunch up" and
 execute in rapid succession when (and if) the offending task finally
 completes.

 <p>After the last live reference to a <tt>Timer</tt> object goes away
 <i>and</i> all outstanding tasks have completed execution, the timer's task
 execution thread terminates gracefully (and becomes subject to garbage
 collection).  However, this can take arbitrarily long to occur.  By
 default, the task execution thread does not run as a <i>daemon thread</i>,
 so it is capable of keeping an application from terminating.  If a caller
 wants to terminate a timer's task execution thread rapidly, the caller
 should invoke the timer's <tt>cancel</tt> method.

 <p>If the timer's task execution thread terminates unexpectedly, for
 example, because its <tt>stop</tt> method is invoked, any further
 attempt to schedule a task on the timer will result in an
 <tt>IllegalStateException</tt>, as if the timer's <tt>cancel</tt>
 method had been invoked.

 <p>This class is thread-safe: multiple threads can share a single
 <tt>Timer</tt> object without the need for external synchronization.

 <p>This class does <i>not</i> offer real-time guarantees: it schedules
 tasks using the <tt>Object.wait(long)</tt> method.

 <p>Implementation note: This class scales to large numbers of concurrently
 scheduled tasks (thousands should present no problem).  Internally,
 it uses a binary heap to represent its task queue, so the cost to schedule
 a task is O(log n), where n is the number of concurrently scheduled tasks.

 <p>Implementation note: All constructors start a timer thread.

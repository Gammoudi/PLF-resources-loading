     * Terminates this timer, discarding any currently scheduled tasks.
     * Does not interfere with a currently executing task (if it exists).
     * Once a timer has been terminated, its execution thread terminates
     * gracefully, and no more tasks may be scheduled on it.
     *
     * <p>Note that calling this method from within the run method of a
     * timer task that was invoked by this timer absolutely guarantees that
     * the ongoing task execution is the last task execution that will ever
     * be performed by this timer.
     *
     * <p>This method may be called repeatedly; the second and subsequent
     * calls have no effect.

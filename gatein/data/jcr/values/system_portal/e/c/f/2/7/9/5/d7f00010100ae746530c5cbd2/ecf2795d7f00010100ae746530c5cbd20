     * Removes all cancelled tasks from this timer's task queue.  <i>Calling
     * this method has no effect on the behavior of the timer</i>, but
     * eliminates the references to the cancelled tasks from the queue.
     * If there are no external references to these tasks, they become
     * eligible for garbage collection.
     *
     * <p>Most programs will have no need to call this method.
     * It is designed for use by the rare application that cancels a large
     * number of tasks.  Calling this method trades time for space: the
     * runtime of the method may be proportional to n + c log n, where n
     * is the number of tasks in the queue and c is the number of cancelled
     * tasks.
     *
     * <p>Note that it is permissible to call this method from within a
     * a task scheduled on this timer.
     *
     * @return the number of tasks removed from the queue.

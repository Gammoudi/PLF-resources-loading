     * Save the state of the {@code TreeSet} instance to a stream (that is,
     * serialize it).
     *
     * @serialData Emits the comparator used to order this set, or
     *             {@code null} if it obeys its elements' natural ordering
     *             (Object), followed by the size of the set (the number of
     *             elements it contains) (int), followed by all of its
     *             elements (each an Object) in order (as determined by the
     *             set's Comparator, or by the elements' natural ordering if
     *             the set has no Comparator).

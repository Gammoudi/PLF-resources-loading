     * Removes the mapping for a key from this weak hash map if it is present.
     * More formally, if this map contains a mapping from key <tt>k</tt> to
     * value <tt>v</tt> such that <code>(key==null ?  k==null :
     * key.equals(k))</code>, that mapping is removed.  (The map can contain
     * at most one such mapping.)
     *
     * <p>Returns the value to which this map previously associated the key,
     * or <tt>null</tt> if the map contained no mapping for the key.  A
     * return value of <tt>null</tt> does not <i>necessarily</i> indicate
     * that the map contained no mapping for the key; it's also possible
     * that the map explicitly mapped the key to <tt>null</tt>.
     *
     * <p>The map will not contain a mapping for the specified key once the
     * call returns.
     *
     * @param key key whose mapping is to be removed from the map
     * @return the previous value associated with <tt>key</tt>, or
     *         <tt>null</tt> if there was no mapping for <tt>key</tt>

     * Rehashes the contents of this map into a new array with a
     * larger capacity.  This method is called automatically when the
     * number of keys in this map reaches its threshold.
     *
     * If current capacity is MAXIMUM_CAPACITY, this method does not
     * resize the map, but sets threshold to Integer.MAX_VALUE.
     * This has the effect of preventing future calls.
     *
     * @param newCapacity the new capacity, MUST be a power of two;
     *        must be greater than current capacity unless current
     *        capacity is MAXIMUM_CAPACITY (in which case value
     *        is irrelevant).

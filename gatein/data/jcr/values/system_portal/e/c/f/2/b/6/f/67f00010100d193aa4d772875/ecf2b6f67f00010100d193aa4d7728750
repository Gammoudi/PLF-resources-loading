     * This method will block until some input can be read and compressed.
     *
     * @param b buffer into which the data is read
     * @param off starting offset of the data within {@code b}
     * @param len maximum number of compressed bytes to read into {@code b}
     * @return the actual number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the
     * uncompressed input stream is reached
     * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException  if {@code len} > {@code b.length -
     * off}
     * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs or if this input stream is

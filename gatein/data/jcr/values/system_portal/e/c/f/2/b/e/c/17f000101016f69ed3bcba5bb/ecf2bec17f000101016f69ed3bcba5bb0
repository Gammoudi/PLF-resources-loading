     * Reads uncompressed data into an array of bytes. If <code>len</code> is not
     * zero, the method will block until some input can be decompressed; otherwise,
     * no bytes are read and <code>0</code> is returned.
     * @param b the buffer into which the data is read
     * @param off the start offset in the destination array <code>b</code>
     * @param len the maximum number of bytes read
     * @return the actual number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the
     *         compressed input is reached or a preset dictionary is needed
     * @exception  NullPointerException If <code>b</code> is <code>null</code>.
     * @exception  IndexOutOfBoundsException If <code>off</code> is negative, 
     * <code>len</code> is negative, or <code>len</code> is greater than 
     * <code>b.length - off</code>
     * @exception ZipException if a ZIP format error has occurred
     * @exception IOException if an I/O error has occurred

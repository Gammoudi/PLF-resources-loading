     * @param b the buffer into which the data is read
     * @param off the start offset in the destination array <code>b</code>
     * @param len the maximum number of bytes read
     * @return the actual number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the
     *         entry is reached
     * @exception  NullPointerException If <code>b</code> is <code>null</code>.
     * @exception  IndexOutOfBoundsException If <code>off</code> is negative,
     * <code>len</code> is negative, or <code>len</code> is greater than
     * <code>b.length - off</code>

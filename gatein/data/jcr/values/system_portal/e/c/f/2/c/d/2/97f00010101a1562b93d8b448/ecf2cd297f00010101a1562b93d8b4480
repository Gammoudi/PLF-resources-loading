     * Causes the current thread to wait until it is signalled or interrupted,
     * or the specified waiting time elapses. This method is behaviorally
     * equivalent to:<br>
     * <pre>
     *   awaitNanos(unit.toNanos(time)) &gt; 0
     * </pre>
     * @param time the maximum time to wait
     * @param unit the time unit of the {@code time} argument
     * @return {@code false} if the waiting time detectably elapsed
     *         before return from the method, else {@code true}
     * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted
     *         (and interruption of thread suspension is supported)

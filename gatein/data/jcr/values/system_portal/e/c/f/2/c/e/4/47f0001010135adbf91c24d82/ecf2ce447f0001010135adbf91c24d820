     * <p><b>Implementation Considerations</b>
     *
     * <p>A {@code Lock} implementation may be able to detect erroneous use
     * of the lock, such as an invocation that would cause deadlock, and
     * may throw an (unchecked) exception in such circumstances.  The
     * circumstances and the exception type must be documented by that
     * {@code Lock} implementation.

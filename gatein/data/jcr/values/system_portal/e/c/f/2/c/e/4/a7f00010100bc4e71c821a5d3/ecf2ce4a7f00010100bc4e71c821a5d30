     * Returns a new {@link Condition} instance that is bound to this
     * {@code Lock} instance.
     *
     * <p>Before waiting on the condition the lock must be held by the
     * current thread.
     * A call to {@link Condition#await()} will atomically release the lock
     * before waiting and re-acquire the lock before the wait returns.
     *
     * <p><b>Implementation Considerations</b>
     *
     * <p>The exact operation of the {@link Condition} instance depends on
     * the {@code Lock} implementation and must be documented by that
     * implementation.
     *
     * @return A new {@link Condition} instance for this {@code Lock} instance
     * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if this {@code Lock}
     *         implementation does not support conditions

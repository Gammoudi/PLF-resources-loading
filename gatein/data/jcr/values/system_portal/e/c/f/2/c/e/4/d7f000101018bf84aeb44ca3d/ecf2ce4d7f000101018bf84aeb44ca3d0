     * Acquires the lock only if it is free at the time of invocation.
     *
     * <p>Acquires the lock if it is available and returns immediately
     * with the value {@code true}.
     * If the lock is not available then this method will return
     * immediately with the value {@code false}.
     *
     * <p>A typical usage idiom for this method would be:
     * <pre>
     *      Lock lock = ...;
     *      if (lock.tryLock()) {
     *          try {
     *              // manipulate protected state
     *          } finally {
     *              lock.unlock();
     *          }
     *      } else {
     *          // perform alternative actions
     *      }
     * </pre>
     * This usage ensures that the lock is unlocked if it was acquired, and
     * doesn't try to unlock if the lock was not acquired.
     *
     * @return {@code true} if the lock was acquired and
     *         {@code false} otherwise

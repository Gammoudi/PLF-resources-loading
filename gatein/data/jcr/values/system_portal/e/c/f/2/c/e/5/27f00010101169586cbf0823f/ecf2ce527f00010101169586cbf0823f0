     * Releases the lock.
     *
     * <p><b>Implementation Considerations</b>
     *
     * <p>A {@code Lock} implementation will usually impose
     * restrictions on which thread can release a lock (typically only the
     * holder of the lock can release it) and may throw
     * an (unchecked) exception if the restriction is violated.
     * Any restrictions and the exception
     * type must be documented by that {@code Lock} implementation.

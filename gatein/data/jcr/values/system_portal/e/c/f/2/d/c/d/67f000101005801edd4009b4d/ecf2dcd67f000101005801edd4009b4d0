     * Attempts to match the input sequence, starting at the beginning of the 
     * region, against the pattern.
     *
     * <p> Like the {@link #matches matches} method, this method always starts
     * at the beginning of the region; unlike that method, it does not
     * require that the entire region be matched.
     *
     * <p> If the match succeeds then more information can be obtained via the
     * <tt>start</tt>, <tt>end</tt>, and <tt>group</tt> methods.  </p>
     *
     * @return  <tt>true</tt> if, and only if, a prefix of the input
     *          sequence matches this matcher's pattern

     * Replaces the first subsequence of the input sequence that matches the
     * pattern with the given replacement string.
     *
     * <p> This method first resets this matcher.  It then scans the input
     * sequence looking for a match of the pattern.  Characters that are not
     * part of the match are appended directly to the result string; the match
     * is replaced in the result by the replacement string.  The replacement
     * string may contain references to captured subsequences as in the {@link
     * #appendReplacement appendReplacement} method.
     *
     * <p>Note that backslashes (<tt>\</tt>) and dollar signs (<tt>$</tt>) in
     * the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it
     * were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be
     * treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and
     * backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement
     * string.
     *
     * <p> Given the regular expression <tt>dog</tt>, the input
     * <tt>"zzzdogzzzdogzzz"</tt>, and the replacement string
     * <tt>"cat"</tt>, an invocation of this method on a matcher for that
     * expression would yield the string <tt>"zzzcatzzzdogzzz"</tt>.  </p>
     *
     * <p> Invoking this method changes this matcher's state.  If the matcher
     * is to be used in further matching operations then it should first be
     * reset.  </p>
     *
     * @param  replacement
     *         The replacement string
     * @return  The string constructed by replacing the first matching
     *          subsequence by the replacement string, substituting captured
     *          subsequences as needed

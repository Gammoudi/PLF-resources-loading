     * <p>Returns true if more input could change a positive match into a 
     * negative one.

     * <p>If this method returns true, and a match was found, then more
     * input could cause the match to be lost. If this method returns false 
     * and a match was found, then more input might change the match but the 
     * match won't be lost. If a match was not found, then requireEnd has no 
     * meaning.

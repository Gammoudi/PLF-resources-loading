     * <p> Resetting a matcher discards all of its explicit state information
     * and sets its append position to zero. The matcher's region is set to the
     * default region, which is its entire character sequence. The anchoring
     * and transparency of this matcher's region boundaries are unaffected.
     *
     * @return  This matcher

     * Resets this matcher with a new input sequence.
     *
     * <p> Resetting a matcher discards all of its explicit state information
     * and sets its append position to zero.  The matcher's region is set to
     * the default region, which is its entire character sequence.  The 
     * anchoring and transparency of this matcher's region boundaries are 
     * unaffected.
     *
     * @param  input
     *         The new input character sequence
     *
     * @return  This matcher

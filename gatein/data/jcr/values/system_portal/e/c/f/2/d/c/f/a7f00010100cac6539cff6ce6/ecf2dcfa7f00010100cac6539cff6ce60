     * Initiates a search to find a Pattern within the given bounds.
     * The groups are filled with default values and the match of the root
     * of the state machine is called. The state machine will hold the state
     * of the match as it proceeds in this matcher.
     * 
     * Matcher.from is not set here, because it is the "hard" boundary
     * of the start of the search which anchors will set to. The from param
     * is the "soft" boundary of the start of the search, meaning that the
     * regex tries to match at that index but ^ won't match there. Subsequent
     * calls to the search methods start at a new "soft" boundary which is
     * the end of the previous match.

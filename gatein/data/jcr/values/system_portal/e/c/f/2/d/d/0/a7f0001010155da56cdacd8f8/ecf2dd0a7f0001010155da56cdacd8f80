     * Sets the anchoring of region bounds for this matcher.
     *
     * <p> Invoking this method with an argument of <tt>true</tt> will set this
     * matcher to use <i>anchoring</i> bounds. If the boolean 
     * argument is <tt>false</tt>, then <i>non-anchoring</i> bounds will be 
     * used.
     * 
     * <p> Using anchoring bounds, the boundaries of this 
     * matcher's region match anchors such as ^ and $.
     *
     * <p> Without anchoring bounds, the boundaries of this 
     * matcher's region will not match anchors such as ^ and $.
     *
     * <p> By default, a matcher uses anchoring region boundaries.
     *
     * @param  b a boolean indicating whether or not to use anchoring bounds.

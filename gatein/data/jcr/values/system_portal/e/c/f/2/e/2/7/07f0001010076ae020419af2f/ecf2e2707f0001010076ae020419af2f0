     * Returns an array of strings that have all the possible
     * permutations of the characters in the input string.
     * This is used to get a list of all possible orderings
     * of a set of combining marks. Note that some of the permutations
     * are invalid because of combining class collisions, and these
     * possibilities must be removed because they are not canonically
     * equivalent.

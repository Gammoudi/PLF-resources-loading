         * Pre calculates arrays needed to generate the bad character
         * shift and the good suffix shift. Only the last seven bits
         * are used to see if chars match; This keeps the tables small
         * and covers the heavily used ASCII range, but occasionally
         * results in an aliased match for the bad character shift.

 Node to anchor at the end of a line or the end of input based on the
 multiline mode.

 When not in multiline mode, the $ can only match at the very end
 of the input, unless the input ends in a line terminator in which
 it matches right before the last line terminator.

 Note that \r\n is considered an atomic line terminator.

 Like ^ the $ operator matches at a position, it does not match the
 line terminators themselves.

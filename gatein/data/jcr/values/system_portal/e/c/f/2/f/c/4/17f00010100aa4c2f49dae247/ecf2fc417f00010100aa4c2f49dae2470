 Handles the curly-brace style repetition with a specified minimum and
 maximum occurrences in deterministic cases. This is an iterative
 optimization over the Prolog and Loop system which would handle this
 in a recursive way. The * quantifier is handled as a special case.
 If capture is true then this class saves group settings and ensures
 that groups are unset when backing off of a group match.

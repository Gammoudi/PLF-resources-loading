 The GroupHead saves the location where the group begins in the locals
 and restores them when the match is done.

 The matchRef is used when a reference to this group is accessed later
 in the expression. The locals will have a negative value in them to
 indicate that we do not want to unset the group if the reference
 doesn't match.

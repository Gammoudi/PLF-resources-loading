 ErrorManager objects can be attached to Handlers to process
 any error that occur on a Handler during Logging.
 <p>
 When processing logging output, if a Handler encounters problems
 then rather than throwing an Exception back to the issuer of
 the logging call (who is unlikely to be interested) the Handler
 should call its associated ErrorManager.

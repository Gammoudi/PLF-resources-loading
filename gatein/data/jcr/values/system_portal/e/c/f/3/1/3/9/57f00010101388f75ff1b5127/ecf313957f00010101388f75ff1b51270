     * Protected convenience method to report an error to this Handler's
     * ErrorManager.  Note that this method retrieves and uses the ErrorManager
     * without doing a security check.  It can therefore be used in
     * environments where the caller may be non-privileged.
     *
     * @param msg    a descriptive string (may be null)
     * @param ex     an exception (may be null)
     * @param code   an error code defined in ErrorManager

     * <p>
     * By default, Loggers also send their output to their parent logger.
     * Typically the root Logger is configured with a set of Handlers
     * that essentially act as default handlers for all loggers.
     *
     * @param	handler	a logging Handler
     * @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and if

     * Create an anonymous Logger.  The newly created Logger is not
     * registered in the LogManager namespace.  There will be no
     * access checks on updates to the logger.
     * <p>
     * This factory method is primarily intended for use from applets.
     * Because the resulting Logger is anonymous it can be kept private
     * by the creating class.  This removes the need for normal security
     * checks, which in turn allows untrusted applet code to update
     * the control state of the Logger.  For example an applet can do
     * a setLevel or an addHandler on an anonymous Logger.
     * <p>
     * Even although the new logger is anonymous, it is configured
     * to have the root logger ("") as its parent.  This means that
     * by default it inherits its effective level and handlers
     * from the root logger.
     * <p>
     *
     * @return a newly created private Logger

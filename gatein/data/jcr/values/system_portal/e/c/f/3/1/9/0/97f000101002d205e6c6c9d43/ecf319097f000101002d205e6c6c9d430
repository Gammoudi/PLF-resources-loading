     * Find or create a logger for a named subsystem.  If a logger has 
     * already been created with the given name it is returned.  Otherwise
     * a new logger is created.
     * <p>
     * If a new logger is created its log level will be configured
     * based on the LogManager and it will configured to also send logging
     * output to its parent loggers Handlers.  It will be registered in
     * the LogManager global namespace.
     * <p>
     * Note: The LogManager may only retain a weak reference to the newly
     * created Logger. It is important to understand that a previously
     * created Logger with the given name may be garbage collected at any
     * time if there is no strong reference to the Logger. In particular,
     * this means that two back-to-back calls like
     * {@code getLogger("MyLogger", ...).log(...)} may use different Logger
     * objects named "MyLogger" if there is no strong reference to the
     * Logger named "MyLogger" elsewhere in the program.
     * <p>
     * If the named Logger already exists and does not yet have a
     * localization resource bundle then the given resource bundle 
     * name is used.  If the named Logger already exists and has
     * a different resource bundle name then an IllegalArgumentException
     * is thrown.
     * <p>
     * @param	name	A name for the logger.  This should
     *				be a dot-separated name and should normally
     *				be based on the package name or class name
     *				of the subsystem, such as java.net
     *				or javax.swing
     * @param 	resourceBundleName  name of ResourceBundle to be used for localizing
     *				messages for this logger. May be <CODE>null</CODE> if none of 
     *				the messages require localization.
     * @return a suitable Logger
     * @throws MissingResourceException if the named ResourceBundle cannot be found.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the Logger already exists and uses
     *		   a different resource bundle name.
     * @throws NullPointerException if the name is null.

     * Return the parent for this Logger.
     * <p>
     * This method returns the nearest extant parent in the namespace.
     * Thus if a Logger is called "a.b.c.d", and a Logger called "a.b"
     * has been created but no logger "a.b.c" exists, then a call of
     * getParent on the Logger "a.b.c.d" will return the Logger "a.b".
     * <p>
     * The result will be null if it is called on the root Logger
     * in the namespace.

     * @return nearest existing parent Logger

     * with associated Throwable information.
     * <p>
     * If the logger is currently enabled for the given message 
     * level then the given arguments are stored in a LogRecord
     * which is forwarded to all registered output handlers.
     * <p>
     * Note that the thrown argument is stored in the LogRecord thrown
     * property, rather than the LogRecord parameters property.  Thus is it
     * processed specially by output Formatters and is not treated
     * as a formatting parameter to the LogRecord message property.
     * <p>

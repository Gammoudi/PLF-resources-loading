     * Set a filter to control output on this Logger.
     * <P>
     * After passing the initial "level" check, the Logger will
     * call this Filter to check if a log record should really
     * be published.
     *
     * @param   newFilter  a filter object (may be null)
     * @exception  SecurityException  if a security manager exists and if
     *             the caller does not have LoggingPermission("control").

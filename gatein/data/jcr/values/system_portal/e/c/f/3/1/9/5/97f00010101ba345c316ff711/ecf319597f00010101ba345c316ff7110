     * Log throwing an exception.
     * <p>
     * This is a convenience method to log that a method is
     * terminating by throwing an exception.  The logging is done 
     * using the FINER level.
     * <p>
     * If the logger is currently enabled for the given message 
     * level then the given arguments are stored in a LogRecord
     * which is forwarded to all registered output handlers.  The
     * LogRecord's message is set to "THROW".
     * <p>
     * Note that the thrown argument is stored in the LogRecord thrown
     * property, rather than the LogRecord parameters property.  Thus is it
     * processed specially by output Formatters and is not treated
     * as a formatting parameter to the LogRecord message property.
     * <p>
     * @param   sourceClass    name of class that issued the logging request
     * @param   sourceMethod  name of the method.
     * @param   thrown  The Throwable that is being thrown.

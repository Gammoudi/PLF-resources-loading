     * The <tt>StreamHandler</tt> first checks if there is an <tt>OutputStream</tt>
     * and if the given <tt>LogRecord</tt> has at least the required log level.
     * If not it silently returns.  If so, it calls any associated
     * <tt>Filter</tt> to check if the record should be published.  If so,
     * it calls its <tt>Formatter</tt> to format the record and then writes 
     * the result to the current output stream.

     * If this is the first <tt>LogRecord</tt> to be written to a given
     * <tt>OutputStream</tt>, the <tt>Formatter</tt>'s "head" string is 
     * written to the stream before the <tt>LogRecord</tt> is written.
